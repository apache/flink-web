      <description>What is Apache Flink? — Operations # Apache Flink is a framework for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Since many streaming applications are designed to run continuously with minimal downtime, a stream processor must provide excellent failure recovery, as well as, tooling to monitor and maintain applications while they are running.
Apache Flink puts a strong focus on the operational aspects of stream processing. Here, we explain Flink&amp;rsquo;s failure recovery mechanism and present its features to manage and supervise running applications.</description>

      <description>Introduction # The Flink community has been deprecating the DataSet API since version 1.12 as part of the work on FLIP-131: Consolidate the user-facing Dataflow SDKs/APIs (and deprecate the DataSet API) . This blog article illustrates the migration of a real-life batch DataSet pipeline to a batch DataStream pipeline. All the code presented in this article is available in the tpcds-benchmark-flink repo. The use case shown here is extracted from a broader work comparing Flink performances of different APIs by implementing TPCDS queries using these APIs.</description>

      <description>Introduction # When designing a Flink data processing job, one of the key concerns is maximising job throughput. Sink throughput is a crucial factor because it can determine the entire job’s throughput. We generally want the highest possible write rate in the sink without overloading the destination. However, since the factors impacting a destination’s performance are variable over the job’s lifetime, the sink needs to adjust its write rate dynamically.</description>

      <description>In the first part of this blog, we have briefly introduced the work to support checkpoints after tasks get finished and revised the process of finishing. In this part we will present more details on the implementation, including how we support checkpoints with finished tasks and the revised protocol of the finish process.
Implementation of support Checkpointing with Finished Tasks # As described in part one, to support checkpoints after some tasks are finished, the core idea is to mark the finished operators in checkpoints and skip executing these operators after recovery.</description>

      <description>Introduction # Deciding proper parallelisms of operators is not an easy work for many users. For batch jobs, a small parallelism may result in long execution time and big failover regression. While an unnecessary large parallelism may result in resource waste and more overhead cost in task deployment and network shuffling.
To decide a proper parallelism, one needs to know how much data each operator needs to process. However, It can be hard to predict data volume to be processed by a job because it can be different everyday.</description>

      <description>Introduction # One of the most important characteristics of stream processing systems is end-to-end latency, i.e. the time it takes for the results of processing an input record to reach the outputs. In the case of Flink, end-to-end latency mostly depends on the checkpointing mechanism, because processing results should only become visible after the state of the stream is persisted to non-volatile storage (this is assuming exactly-once mode; in other modes, results can be published immediately).</description>

In part one, we discussed the types of latency in Flink and the way we measure end-to-end latency and presented a few techniques that optimize latency directly. In this post, we will continue with a few more direct latency optimization techniques. Just like in part one, for each optimization technique, we will clarify what it is, when to use it, and what to keep in mind when using it.</description>

      <description>Flink has become a well established data streaming engine and a mature project requires some shifting of priorities from thinking purely about new features towards improving stability and operational simplicity. In the last couple of releases, the Flink community has tried to address some known friction points, which includes improvements to the snapshotting process. Snapshotting takes a global, consistent image of the state of a Flink job and is integral to fault-tolerance and exacty-once processing.</description>

      <description>The Apache Flink Community is pleased to announce the preview release of the Apache Flink Kubernetes Operator (0.1.0)
The Flink Kubernetes Operator allows users to easily manage their Flink deployment lifecycle using native Kubernetes tooling.
The operator takes care of submitting, savepointing, upgrading and generally managing Flink jobs using the built-in Flink Kubernetes integration. This way users do not have to use the Flink Clients (e.g. CLI) or interact with the Flink jobs manually, they only have to declare the desired deployment specification and the operator will take care of the rest.</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2022/03/16/the-generic-asynchronous-base-sink/</guid>
      <description>Flink sinks share a lot of similar behavior. Most sinks batch records according to user-defined buffering hints, sign requests, write them to the destination, retry unsuccessful or throttled requests, and participate in checkpointing.
This is why for Flink 1.15 we have decided to create the AsyncSinkBase (FLIP-171), an abstract sink with a number of common functionalities extracted.
This is a base implementation for asynchronous sinks, which you should use whenever you need to implement a sink that doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer transactional capabilities.</description>

      <description>Introduction # When scheduling large-scale jobs in Flink 1.12, a lot of time is required to initialize jobs and deploy tasks. The scheduler also requires a large amount of heap memory in order to store the execution topology and host temporary deployment descriptors. For example, for a job with a topology that contains two vertices connected with an all-to-all edge and a parallelism of 10k (which means there are 10k source tasks and 10k sink tasks and every source task is connected to all sink tasks), Flink’s JobManager would require 30 GiB of heap memory and more than 4 minutes to deploy all of the tasks.</description>

      <description>Part one of this blog post briefly introduced the optimizations we’ve made to improve the performance of the scheduler; compared to Flink 1.12, the time cost and memory usage of scheduling large-scale jobs in Flink 1.14 is significantly reduced. In part two, we will elaborate on the details of these optimizations.
Reducing complexity with groups # A distribution pattern describes how consumer tasks are connected to producer tasks. Currently, there are two distribution patterns in Flink: pointwise and all-to-all.</description>

      <description>It has now been a month since the community released Apache Flink 1.14 into the wild. We had a comprehensive look at the enhancements, additions, and fixups in the release announcement blog post, and now we will look at the development cycle from a different angle. Based on feedback collected from contributors involved in this release, we will explore the experiences and processes behind it all.
A retrospective on the release cycle # From the team, we collected emotions that have been attributed to points in time of the 1.</description>

      <description>Part one of this blog post will explain the motivation behind introducing sort-based blocking shuffle, present benchmark results, and provide guidelines on how to use this new feature.
How data gets passed around between operators # Data shuffling is an important stage in batch processing applications and describes how data is sent from one operator to the next. In this phase, output data of the upstream operator will spill over to persistent storages like disk, then the downstream operator will read the corresponding data and process it.</description>

      <description>Part one of this blog post explained the motivation behind introducing sort-based blocking shuffle, presented benchmark results, and provided guidelines on how to use this new feature.
Like sort-merge shuffle implemented by other distributed data processing frameworks, the whole sort-based shuffle process in Flink consists of several important stages, including collecting data in memory, sorting the collected data in memory, spilling the sorted data to files, and reading the shuffle data from these spilled files.</description>

      <description>Introduction # Streaming jobs which run for several days or longer usually experience variations in workload during their lifetime. These variations can originate from seasonal spikes, such as day vs. night, weekdays vs. weekend or holidays vs. non-holidays, sudden events or simply the growing popularity of your product. Although some of these variations are more predictable than others, in all cases there is a change in job resource demand that needs to be addressed if you want to ensure the same quality of service for your customers.</description>

This new release brings remote functions to the front and center of StateFun, making the disaggregated setup that separates the application logic from the StateFun cluster the default. It is now easier, more efficient, and more ergonomic to write applications that live in their own processes or containers.</description>

      <description>Flink has been following the mantra that Batch is a Special Case of Streaming since the very early days. As the project evolved to address specific uses cases, different core APIs ended up being implemented for batch (DataSet API) and streaming execution (DataStream API), but the higher-level Table API/SQL was subsequently designed following this mantra of unification. With Flink 1.12, the community worked on bringing a similarly unified behaviour to the DataStream API, and took the first steps towards enabling efficient batch execution in the DataStream API.</description>

      <description>Flink has supported resource management systems like YARN and Mesos since the early days; however, these were not designed for the fast-moving cloud-native architectures that are increasingly gaining popularity these days, or the growing need to support complex, mixed workloads (e.g. batch, streaming, deep learning, web services). For these reasons, more and more users are using Kubernetes to automate the deployment, scaling and management of their Flink applications.
From release to release, the Flink community has made significant progress in integrating natively with Kubernetes, from active resource management to “Zookeeperless” High Availability (HA).</description>

      <description>Stream processing applications are often stateful, “remembering” information from processed events and using it to influence further event processing. In Flink, the remembered information, i.e., state, is stored locally in the configured state backend. To prevent data loss in case of failures, the state backend periodically persists a snapshot of its contents to a pre-configured durable storage. The RocksDB state backend (i.e., RocksDBStateBackend) is one of the three built-in state backends in Flink.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink is a very versatile tool for all kinds of data processing workloads. It can process incoming data within a few milliseconds or crunch through petabytes of bounded datasets (also known as batch processing).
Processing efficiency is not the only parameter users of data processing systems care about. In the real world, system outages due to hardware or software failure are expected to happen all the time. For unbounded (or streaming) workloads, Flink is using periodic checkpoints to allow for reliable and correct recovery.</description>

      <description>About the Pulsar Flink Connector # In order for companies to access real-time data insights, they need unified batch and streaming capabilities. Apache Flink unifies batch and stream processing into one single computing engine with “streams” as the unified data representation. Although developers have done extensive work at the computing and API layers, very little work has been done at the data messaging and storage layers. In reality, data is segregated into data silos, created by various storage and messaging technologies.</description>

      <description>The Apache Flink community released the second bugfix release of the Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.2 series, version 2.2.2.
The most important change of this bugfix release is upgrading Apache Flink to version 1.11.3. In addition to many stability fixes to the Flink runtime itself, this also allows StateFun applications to safely use savepoints to upgrade from older versions earlier than StateFun 2.2.1. Previously, restoring from savepoints could have failed under certain conditions.</description>

      <description>The Flink community has been working for some time on making Flink a truly unified batch and stream processing system. Achieving this involves touching a lot of different components of the Flink stack, from the user-facing APIs all the way to low-level operator processes such as task scheduling. In this blogpost, we’ll take a closer look at how far the community has come in improving scheduling for batch workloads, why this matters and what you can expect in the Flink 1.</description>

      <description>The Apache Flink community released the first bugfix release of the Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.2 series, version 2.2.1.
This release fixes a critical bug that causes restoring the Stateful Functions cluster from snapshots (checkpoints or savepoints) to fail under certain conditions. Starting from this release, StateFun now creates snapshots with a more robust format that allows it to be restored safely going forward.
We strongly recommend all users to upgrade to 2.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink’s checkpoint-based fault tolerance mechanism is one of its defining features. Because of that design, Flink unifies batch and stream processing, can easily scale to both very small and extremely large scenarios and provides support for many operational features like stateful upgrades with state evolution or roll-backs and time-travel.
Despite all these great properties, Flink&amp;rsquo;s checkpointing method has an Achilles Heel: the speed of a completed checkpoint is determined by the speed at which data flows through the application.</description>

      <description>Stateful Functions (StateFun) simplifies the building of distributed stateful applications by combining the best of two worlds: the strong messaging and state consistency guarantees of stateful stream processing, and the elasticity and serverless experience of today&amp;rsquo;s cloud-native architectures and popular event-driven FaaS platforms. Typical StateFun applications consist of functions deployed behind simple services using these modern platforms, with a separate StateFun cluster playing the role of an “event-driven database” that provides consistency and fault-tolerance for the functions&amp;rsquo; state and messaging.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a class of use cases that is a natural fit for Flink Stateful Functions: monitoring and controlling networks of connected devices (often called the “Internet of Things” (IoT)).
IoT networks are composed of many individual, but interconnected components, which makes getting some kind of high-level insight into the status, problems, or optimization opportunities in these networks not trivial. Each individual device “sees” only its own state, which means that the status of groups of devices, or even the network as a whole, is often a complex aggregation of the individual devices’ state.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink 1.11 introduces a new External Resource Framework, which allows you to request external resources from the underlying resource management systems (e.g., Kubernetes) and accelerate your workload with those resources. As Flink provides a first-party GPU plugin at the moment, we will take GPU as an example and show how it affects Flink applications in the AI field. Other external resources (e.g. RDMA and SSD) can also be supported in a pluggable manner.</description>

      <description>Python has evolved into one of the most important programming languages for many fields of data processing. So big has been Python’s popularity, that it has pretty much become the default data processing language for data scientists. On top of that, there is a plethora of Python-based data processing tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn that have gained additional popularity due to their flexibility or powerful functionalities.

      <description>Introduction # In the previous articles of the series, we described how you can achieve flexible stream partitioning based on dynamically-updated configurations (a set of fraud-detection rules) and how you can utilize Flink&#39;s Broadcast mechanism to distribute processing configuration at runtime among the relevant operators. Following up directly where we left the discussion of the end-to-end solution last time, in this article we will describe how you can use the &amp;quot;Swiss knife&amp;quot; of Flink - the Process Function to create an implementation that is tailor-made to match your streaming business logic requirements.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink 1.11 has released many exciting new features, including many developments in Flink SQL which is evolving at a fast pace. This article takes a closer look at how to quickly build streaming applications with Flink SQL from a practical point of view.
In the following sections, we describe how to integrate Kafka, MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Kibana with Flink SQL to analyze e-commerce user behavior in real-time. All exercises in this blogpost are performed in the Flink SQL CLI, and the entire process uses standard SQL syntax, without a single line of Java/Scala code or IDE installation.</description>

      <description>With an ever-growing number of people working with data, it&amp;rsquo;s a common practice for companies to build self-service platforms with the goal of democratizing their access across different teams and — especially — to enable users from any background to be independent in their data needs. In such environments, metadata management becomes a crucial aspect. Without it, users often work blindly, spending too much time searching for datasets and their location, figuring out data formats and similar cumbersome tasks.</description>

      <description>Almost every Flink job has to exchange data between its operators and since these records may not only be sent to another instance in the same JVM but instead to a separate process, records need to be serialized to bytes first. Similarly, Flink’s off-heap state-backend is based on a local embedded RocksDB instance which is implemented in native C++ code and thus also needs transformation into bytes on every state access.</description>

      <description>Flink 1.9 introduced the Python Table API, allowing developers and data engineers to write Python Table API jobs for Table transformations and analysis, such as Python ETL or aggregate jobs. However, Python users faced some limitations when it came to support for Python UDFs in Flink 1.9, preventing them from extending the system’s built-in functionality.
In Flink 1.10, the community further extended the support for Python by adding Python UDFs in PyFlink.</description>

      <description>Today, we are announcing the release of Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.0 — the first release of Stateful Functions as part of the Apache Flink project. This release marks a big milestone: Stateful Functions 2.0 is not only an API update, but the first version of an event-driven database that is built on Apache Flink.
Stateful Functions 2.0 makes it possible to combine StateFun’s powerful approach to state and composition with the elasticity, rapid scaling/scale-to-zero and rolling upgrade capabilities of FaaS implementations like AWS Lambda and modern resource orchestration frameworks like Kubernetes.</description>

      <description>In the first article of the series, we gave a high-level description of the objectives and required functionality of a Fraud Detection engine. We also described how to make data partitioning in Apache Flink customizable based on modifiable rules instead of using a hardcoded KeysExtractor implementation.
We intentionally omitted details of how the applied rules are initialized and what possibilities exist for updating them at runtime. In this post, we will address exactly these details.</description>

      <description>Note: This blog post is based on the talk &amp;ldquo;Beam on Flink: How Does It Actually Work?&amp;rdquo;.
Apache Flink and Apache Beam are open-source frameworks for parallel, distributed data processing at scale. Unlike Flink, Beam does not come with a full-blown execution engine of its own but plugs into other execution engines, such as Apache Flink, Apache Spark, or Google Cloud Dataflow. In this blog post we discuss the reasons to use Flink together with Beam for your batch and stream processing needs.</description>

      <description>Introduction # The recent Apache Flink 1.10 release includes many exciting features. In particular, it marks the end of the community&amp;rsquo;s year-long effort to merge in the Blink SQL contribution from Alibaba. The reason the community chose to spend so much time on the contribution is that SQL works. It allows Flink to offer a truly unified interface over batch and streaming and makes stream processing accessible to a broad audience of developers and analysts.</description>

      <description>Writing unit tests is one of the essential tasks of designing a production-grade application. Without tests, a single change in code can result in cascades of failure in production. Thus unit tests should be written for all types of applications, be it a simple job cleaning data and training a model or a complex multi-tenant, real-time data processing system. In the following sections, we provide a guide for unit testing of Apache Flink applications.</description>

      <description>In this series of blog posts you will learn about three powerful Flink patterns for building streaming applications:
Dynamic updates of application logic Dynamic data partitioning (shuffle), controlled at runtime Low latency alerting based on custom windowing logic (without using the window API) These patterns expand the possibilities of what is achievable with statically defined data flows and provide the building blocks to fulfill complex business requirements.
Dynamic updates of application logic allow Flink jobs to change at runtime, without downtime from stopping and resubmitting the code.</description>

      <description>A common use case for Apache Flink is streaming data analytics together with Apache Kafka, which provides a pub/sub model and durability for data streams. To achieve elastic scalability, both are typically deployed in clustered environments, and increasingly on top of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. The Operator pattern provides an extension mechanism to Kubernetes that captures human operator knowledge about an application, like Flink, in software to automate its operation.</description>

      <description>Whether you are running Apache FlinkⓇ in production or evaluated Flink as a computation framework in the past, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably found yourself asking the question: How can I access, write or update state in a Flink savepoint? Ask no more! Apache Flink 1.9.0 introduces the State Processor API, a powerful extension of the DataSet API that allows reading, writing and modifying state in Flink&amp;rsquo;s savepoints and checkpoints.
In this post, we explain why this feature is a big step for Flink, what you can use it for, and how to use it.</description>

      <description>In a previous blog post, we presented how Flink’s network stack works from the high-level abstractions to the low-level details. This second blog post in the series of network stack posts extends on this knowledge and discusses monitoring network-related metrics to identify effects such as backpressure or bottlenecks in throughput and latency. Although this post briefly covers what to do with backpressure, the topic of tuning the network stack will be further examined in a future post.</description>

      <description>Since version 1.5.0, Apache Flink features a new type of state which is called Broadcast State. In this post, we explain what Broadcast State is, and show an example of how it can be applied to an application that evaluates dynamic patterns on an event stream. We walk you through the processing steps and the source code to implement this application in practice.
What is Broadcast State? # The Broadcast State can be used to combine and jointly process two streams of events in a specific way.</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2019/06/05/a-deep-dive-into-flinks-network-stack/</guid>
      <description>Flink’s network stack is one of the core components that make up the flink-runtime module and sit at the heart of every Flink job. It connects individual work units (subtasks) from all TaskManagers. This is where your streamed-in data flows through and it is therefore crucial to the performance of your Flink job for both the throughput as well as latency you observe. In contrast to the coordination channels between TaskManagers and JobManagers which are using RPCs via Akka, the network stack between TaskManagers relies on a much lower-level API using Netty.</description>

      <description>A common requirement for many stateful streaming applications is to automatically cleanup application state for effective management of your state size, or to control how long the application state can be accessed (e.g. due to legal regulations like the GDPR). The state time-to-live (TTL) feature was initiated in Flink 1.6.0 and enabled application state cleanup and efficient state size management in Apache Flink.
In this post, we motivate the State TTL feature and discuss its use cases.</description>

      <description>Figuring out how to manage and model temporal data for effective point-in-time analysis was a longstanding battle, dating as far back as the early 80’s, that culminated with the introduction of temporal tables in the SQL standard in 2011. Up to that point, users were doomed to implement this as part of the application logic, often hurting the length of the development lifecycle as well as the maintainability of the code.</description>

      <description>The open source data technology frameworks Apache Flink and Apache Pulsar can integrate in different ways to provide elastic data processing at large scale. I recently gave a talk at Flink Forward San Francisco 2019 and presented some of the integrations between the two frameworks for batch and streaming applications. In this post, I will give a short introduction to Apache Pulsar and its differentiating elements from other messaging systems and describe the ways that Pulsar and Flink can work together to provide a seamless developer experience for elastic data processing at scale.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink was purpose-built for stateful stream processing. However, what is state in a stream processing application? I defined state and stateful stream processing in a previous blog post, and in case you need a refresher, state is defined as memory in an application&amp;rsquo;s operators that stores information about previously-seen events that you can use to influence the processing of future events.
State is a fundamental, enabling concept in stream processing required for a majority of complex use cases.</description>

This post provides a detailed overview of stateful stream processing and rescalable state in Flink. An Intro to Stateful Stream Processing # At a high level, we can consider state in stream processing as memory in operators that remembers information about past input and can be used to influence the processing of future input.
In contrast, operators in stateless stream processing only consider their current inputs, without further context and knowledge about the past.</description>

      <description>Analyzing Data Streams with SQL # More and more companies are adopting stream processing and are migrating existing batch applications to streaming or implementing streaming solutions for new use cases. Many of those applications focus on analyzing streaming data. The data streams that are analyzed come from a wide variety of sources such as database transactions, clicks, sensor measurements, or IoT devices.
Apache Flink is very well suited to power streaming analytics applications because it provides support for event-time semantics, stateful exactly-once processing, and achieves high throughput and low latency at the same time.</description>

      <description>Stream processing can deliver a lot of value. Many organizations have recognized the benefit of managing large volumes of data in real-time, reacting quickly to trends, and providing customers with live services at scale. Streaming applications with well-defined business logic can deliver a competitive advantage.
Flink&amp;rsquo;s DataStream abstraction is a powerful API which lets you flexibly define both basic and complex streaming pipelines. Additionally, it offers low-level operations such as Async IO and ProcessFunctions.</description>

      <description>The capabilities of open source systems for distributed stream processing have evolved significantly over the last years. Initially, the first systems in the field (notably Apache Storm) provided low latency processing, but were limited to at-least-once guarantees, processing-time semantics, and rather low-level APIs. Since then, several new systems emerged and pushed the state of the art of open source stream processing in several dimensions. Today, users of Apache Flink or Apache Beam can use fluent Scala and Java APIs to implement stream processing jobs that operate in event-time with exactly-once semantics at high throughput and low latency.</description>

      <description>With the ubiquity of sensor networks and smart devices continuously collecting more and more data, we face the challenge to analyze an ever growing stream of data in near real-time. Being able to react quickly to changing trends or to deliver up to date business intelligence can be a decisive factor for a company’s success or failure. A key problem in real time processing is the detection of event patterns in data streams.</description>

      <description>Apache Storm was one of the first distributed and scalable stream processing systems available in the open source space offering (near) real-time tuple-by-tuple processing semantics. Initially released by the developers at Backtype in 2011 under the Eclipse open-source license, it became popular very quickly. Only shortly afterwards, Twitter acquired Backtype. Since then, Storm has been growing in popularity, is used in production at many big companies, and is the de-facto industry standard for big data stream processing.</description>

      <description>The data analysis space is witnessing an evolution from batch to stream processing for many use cases. Although batch can be handled as a special case of stream processing, analyzing never-ending streaming data often requires a shift in the mindset and comes with its own terminology (for example, “windowing” and “at-least-once”/”exactly-once” processing). This shift and the new terminology can be quite confusing for people being new to the space of stream processing.</description>

      <description>The Apache Flink community is pleased to announce the availability of the 0.10.0 release. The community put significant effort into improving and extending Apache Flink since the last release, focusing on data stream processing and operational features. About 80 contributors provided bug fixes, improvements, and new features such that in total more than 400 JIRA issues could be resolved.
For Flink 0.10.0, the focus of the community was to graduate the DataStream API from beta and to evolve Apache Flink into a production-ready stream data processor with a competitive feature set.</description>

      <description>Running data-intensive code in the JVM and making it well-behaved is tricky. Systems that put billions of data objects naively onto the JVM heap face unpredictable OutOfMemoryErrors and Garbage Collection stalls. Of course, you still want to to keep your data in memory as much as possible, for speed and responsiveness of the processing applications. In that context, &amp;ldquo;off-heap&amp;rdquo; has become almost something like a magic word to solve these problems.</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2015/08/24/introducing-gelly-graph-processing-with-apache-flink/</guid>
      <description>This blog post introduces Gelly, Apache Flink&amp;rsquo;s graph-processing API and library. Flink&amp;rsquo;s native support for iterations makes it a suitable platform for large-scale graph analytics. By leveraging delta iterations, Gelly is able to map various graph processing models such as vertex-centric or gather-sum-apply to Flink dataflows.
Gelly allows Flink users to perform end-to-end data analysis in a single system. Gelly can be seamlessly used with Flink&amp;rsquo;s DataSet API, which means that pre-processing, graph creation, analysis, and post-processing can be done in the same application.</description>

      <description>How Apache Flink operates on binary data # Nowadays, a lot of open-source systems for analyzing large data sets are implemented in Java or other JVM-based programming languages. The most well-known example is Apache Hadoop, but also newer frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Drill, and also Apache Flink run on JVMs. A common challenge that JVM-based data analysis engines face is to store large amounts of data in memory - both for caching and for efficient processing such as sorting and joining of data.</description>

      <description>Join Processing in Apache Flink # Joins are prevalent operations in many data processing applications. Most data processing systems feature APIs that make joining data sets very easy. However, the internal algorithms for join processing are much more involved – especially if large data sets need to be efficiently handled. Therefore, join processing serves as a good example to discuss the salient design points and implementation details of a data processing system.</description>

      <description>This post is the first of a series of blog posts on Flink Streaming, the recent addition to Apache Flink that makes it possible to analyze continuous data sources in addition to static files. Flink Streaming uses the pipelined Flink engine to process data streams in real time and offers a new API including definition of flexible windows.
In this post, we go through an example that uses the Flink Streaming API to compute statistics on stock market data that arrive continuously and combine the stock market data with Twitter streams.</description>

      <description>Apache Hadoop is an industry standard for scalable analytical data processing. Many data analysis applications have been implemented as Hadoop MapReduce jobs and run in clusters around the world. Apache Flink can be an alternative to MapReduce and improves it in many dimensions. Among other features, Flink provides much better performance and offers APIs in Java and Scala, which are very easy to use. Similar to Hadoop, Flink’s APIs provide interfaces for Mapper and Reducer functions, as well as Input- and OutputFormats along with many more operators.</description>
