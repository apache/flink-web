      <description>What is Apache Flink? — Operations # Apache Flink is a framework for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams. Since many streaming applications are designed to run continuously with minimal downtime, a stream processor must provide excellent failure recovery, as well as tooling to monitor and maintain applications while they are running.&#xA;Apache Flink puts a strong focus on the operational aspects of stream processing. Here, we explain Flink&amp;rsquo;s failure recovery mechanism and present its features to manage and supervise running applications.</description>

      <description>Introduction # When designing a Flink data processing job, one of the key concerns is maximising job throughput. Sink throughput is a crucial factor because it can determine the entire job’s throughput. We generally want the highest possible write rate in the sink without overloading the destination. However, since the factors impacting a destination’s performance are variable over the job’s lifetime, the sink needs to adjust its write rate dynamically.</description>

      <description>Motivation # Flink is a distributed processing engine for both unbounded and bounded streams of data. In recent versions, Flink has unified the DataStream API and the Table / SQL API to support both streaming and batch cases. Since most users require both types of data processing pipelines, the unification helps reduce the complexity of developing, operating, and maintaining consistency between streaming and batch backfilling jobs, like the case for Alibaba.</description>

      <description>Introduction # Deciding proper parallelisms of operators is not an easy work for many users. For batch jobs, a small parallelism may result in long execution time and big failover regression. While an unnecessary large parallelism may result in resource waste and more overhead cost in task deployment and network shuffling.&#xA;To decide a proper parallelism, one needs to know how much data each operator needs to process. However, It can be hard to predict data volume to be processed by a job because it can be different everyday.</description>

      <description>Introduction # One of the most important characteristics of stream processing systems is end-to-end latency, i.e. the time it takes for the results of processing an input record to reach the outputs. In the case of Flink, end-to-end latency mostly depends on the checkpointing mechanism, because processing results should only become visible after the state of the stream is persisted to non-volatile storage (this is assuming exactly-once mode; in other modes, results can be published immediately).</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2022/04/03/apache-flink-kubernetes-operator-0.1.0-release-announcement/</guid>
      <description>The Apache Flink Community is pleased to announce the preview release of the Apache Flink Kubernetes Operator (0.1.0)&#xA;The Flink Kubernetes Operator allows users to easily manage their Flink deployment lifecycle using native Kubernetes tooling.&#xA;The operator takes care of submitting, savepointing, upgrading and generally managing Flink jobs using the built-in Flink Kubernetes integration. This way users do not have to use the Flink Clients (e.g. CLI) or interact with the Flink jobs manually, they only have to declare the desired deployment specification and the operator will take care of the rest.</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2022/03/16/the-generic-asynchronous-base-sink/</guid>
      <description>Flink sinks share a lot of similar behavior. Most sinks batch records according to user-defined buffering hints, sign requests, write them to the destination, retry unsuccessful or throttled requests, and participate in checkpointing.&#xA;This is why for Flink 1.15 we have decided to create the AsyncSinkBase (FLIP-171), an abstract sink with a number of common functionalities extracted.&#xA;This is a base implementation for asynchronous sinks, which you should use whenever you need to implement a sink that doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer transactional capabilities.</description>

      <description>Introduction # When scheduling large-scale jobs in Flink 1.12, a lot of time is required to initialize jobs and deploy tasks. The scheduler also requires a large amount of heap memory in order to store the execution topology and host temporary deployment descriptors. For example, for a job with a topology that contains two vertices connected with an all-to-all edge and a parallelism of 10k (which means there are 10k source tasks and 10k sink tasks and every source task is connected to all sink tasks), Flink’s JobManager would require 30 GiB of heap memory and more than 4 minutes to deploy all of the tasks.</description>

      <description>Part one of this blog post briefly introduced the optimizations we’ve made to improve the performance of the scheduler; compared to Flink 1.12, the time cost and memory usage of scheduling large-scale jobs in Flink 1.14 is significantly reduced. In part two, we will elaborate on the details of these optimizations.&#xA;Reducing complexity with groups # A distribution pattern describes how consumer tasks are connected to producer tasks.

      <description>Backpressure monitoring in the web UI&#xA;The backpressure topic was tackled from different angles over the last couple of years. However, when it comes to identifying and analyzing sources of backpressure, things have changed quite a bit in the recent Flink releases (especially with new additions to metrics and the web UI in Flink 1.13). This post will try to clarify some of these changes and go into more detail about how to track down the source of backpressure, but first&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Introduction # Streaming jobs which run for several days or longer usually experience variations in workload during their lifetime. These variations can originate from seasonal spikes, such as day vs. night, weekdays vs. weekend or holidays vs. non-holidays, sudden events or simply the growing popularity of your product. Although some of these variations are more predictable than others, in all cases there is a change in job resource demand that needs to be addressed if you want to ensure the same quality of service for your customers.</description>

      <description>The Apache Flink community is happy to announce the release of Stateful Functions (StateFun) 3.0.0! Stateful Functions is a cross-platform stack for building Stateful Serverless applications, making it radically simpler to develop scalable, consistent, and elastic distributed applications.&#xA;This new release brings remote functions to the front and center of StateFun, making the disaggregated setup that separates the application logic from the StateFun cluster the default. It is now easier, more efficient, and more ergonomic to write applications that live in their own processes or containers.</description>

      <title>A Rundown of Batch Execution Mode in the DataStream API</title>

      <description>Flink has been following the mantra that Batch is a Special Case of Streaming since the very early days. As the project evolved to address specific uses cases, different core APIs ended up being implemented for batch (DataSet API) and streaming execution (DataStream API), but the higher-level Table API/SQL was subsequently designed following this mantra of unification. With Flink 1.12, the community worked on bringing a similarly unified behaviour to the DataStream API, and took the first steps towards enabling efficient batch execution in the DataStream API.</description>

      <description>Flink has supported resource management systems like YARN and Mesos since the early days; however, these were not designed for the fast-moving cloud-native architectures that are increasingly gaining popularity these days, or the growing need to support complex, mixed workloads (e.g. batch, streaming, deep learning, web services). For these reasons, more and more users are using Kubernetes to automate the deployment, scaling and management of their Flink applications.&#xA;From release to release, the Flink community has made significant progress in integrating natively with Kubernetes, from active resource management to “Zookeeperless” High Availability (HA).</description>

      <description>Stream processing applications are often stateful, “remembering” information from processed events and using it to influence further event processing. In Flink, the remembered information, i.e., state, is stored locally in the configured state backend. To prevent data loss in case of failures, the state backend periodically persists a snapshot of its contents to a pre-configured durable storage. The RocksDB state backend (i.e., RocksDBStateBackend) is one of the three built-in state backends in Flink.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink is a very versatile tool for all kinds of data processing workloads. It can process incoming data within a few milliseconds or crunch through petabytes of bounded datasets (also known as batch processing).&#xA;Processing efficiency is not the only parameter users of data processing systems care about. In the real world, system outages due to hardware or software failure are expected to happen all the time. For unbounded (or streaming) workloads, Flink is using periodic checkpoints to allow for reliable and correct recovery.</description>

      <description>About the Pulsar Flink Connector # In order for companies to access real-time data insights, they need unified batch and streaming capabilities. Apache Flink unifies batch and stream processing into one single computing engine with “streams” as the unified data representation. Although developers have done extensive work at the computing and API layers, very little work has been done at the data messaging and storage layers. In reality, data is segregated into data silos, created by various storage and messaging technologies.</description>

      <description>The Flink community has been working for some time on making Flink a truly unified batch and stream processing system. Achieving this involves touching a lot of different components of the Flink stack, from the user-facing APIs all the way to low-level operator processes such as task scheduling. In this blogpost, we’ll take a closer look at how far the community has come in improving scheduling for batch workloads, why this matters and what you can expect in the Flink 1.</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2020/11/11/stateful-functions-2.2.1-release-announcement/</guid>
      <description>The Apache Flink community released the first bugfix release of the Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.2 series, version 2.2.1.&#xA;This release fixes a critical bug that causes restoring the Stateful Functions cluster from snapshots (checkpoints or savepoints) to fail under certain conditions. Starting from this release, StateFun now creates snapshots with a more robust format that allows it to be restored safely going forward.&#xA;We strongly recommend all users to upgrade to 2.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink’s checkpoint-based fault tolerance mechanism is one of its defining features. Because of that design, Flink unifies batch and stream processing, can easily scale to both very small and extremely large scenarios and provides support for many operational features like stateful upgrades with state evolution or roll-backs and time-travel.&#xA;Despite all these great properties, Flink&amp;rsquo;s checkpointing method has an Achilles Heel: the speed of a completed checkpoint is determined by the speed at which data flows through the application.</description>

      <description>Stateful Functions (StateFun) simplifies the building of distributed stateful applications by combining the best of two worlds: the strong messaging and state consistency guarantees of stateful stream processing, and the elasticity and serverless experience of today&amp;rsquo;s cloud-native architectures and popular event-driven FaaS platforms. Typical StateFun applications consist of functions deployed behind simple services using these modern platforms, with a separate StateFun cluster playing the role of an “event-driven database” that provides consistency and fault-tolerance for the functions&amp;rsquo; state and messaging.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at a class of use cases that is a natural fit for Flink Stateful Functions: monitoring and controlling networks of connected devices (often called the “Internet of Things” (IoT)).&#xA;IoT networks are composed of many individual, but interconnected components, which makes getting some kind of high-level insight into the status, problems, or optimization opportunities in these networks not trivial. Each individual device “sees” only its own state, which means that the status of groups of devices, or even the network as a whole, is often a complex aggregation of the individual devices’ state.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink 1.11 introduces a new External Resource Framework, which allows you to request external resources from the underlying resource management systems (e.g., Kubernetes) and accelerate your workload with those resources. As Flink provides a first-party GPU plugin at the moment, we will take GPU as an example and show how it affects Flink applications in the AI field. Other external resources (e.g. RDMA and SSD) can also be supported in a pluggable manner.</description>

      <description>Python has evolved into one of the most important programming languages for many fields of data processing. So big has been Python’s popularity, that it has pretty much become the default data processing language for data scientists. On top of that, there is a plethora of Python-based data processing tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn that have gained additional popularity due to their flexibility or powerful functionalities.&#xA;Pic source: VanderPlas 2017, slide 52.</description>

      <description>With an ever-growing number of people working with data, it&amp;rsquo;s a common practice for companies to build self-service platforms with the goal of democratizing their access across different teams and — especially — to enable users from any background to be independent in their data needs. In such environments, metadata management becomes a crucial aspect. Without it, users often work blindly, spending too much time searching for datasets and their location, figuring out data formats and similar cumbersome tasks.</description>

I wrote 2 posts about how to use Flink in Zeppelin. This is part-1 where I explain how the Flink interpreter in Zeppelin works, and provide a tutorial for running Streaming ETL with Flink on Zeppelin.</description>

      <description>Almost every Flink job has to exchange data between its operators and since these records may not only be sent to another instance in the same JVM but instead to a separate process, records need to be serialized to bytes first. Similarly, Flink’s off-heap state-backend is based on a local embedded RocksDB instance which is implemented in native C++ code and thus also needs transformation into bytes on every state access.</description>

      <description>Flink 1.9 introduced the Python Table API, allowing developers and data engineers to write Python Table API jobs for Table transformations and analysis, such as Python ETL or aggregate jobs. However, Python users faced some limitations when it came to support for Python UDFs in Flink 1.9, preventing them from extending the system’s built-in functionality.&#xA;In Flink 1.10, the community further extended the support for Python by adding Python UDFs in PyFlink.</description>

      <description>Writing unit tests is one of the essential tasks of designing a production-grade application. Without tests, a single change in code can result in cascades of failure in production. Thus unit tests should be written for all types of applications, be it a simple job cleaning data and training a model or a complex multi-tenant, real-time data processing system. In the following sections, we provide a guide for unit testing of Apache Flink applications.</description>

      <description>A common use case for Apache Flink is streaming data analytics together with Apache Kafka, which provides a pub/sub model and durability for data streams. To achieve elastic scalability, both are typically deployed in clustered environments, and increasingly on top of container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. The Operator pattern provides an extension mechanism to Kubernetes that captures human operator knowledge about an application, like Flink, in software to automate its operation.</description>

      <description>In a previous blog post, we presented how Flink’s network stack works from the high-level abstractions to the low-level details. This second blog post in the series of network stack posts extends on this knowledge and discusses monitoring network-related metrics to identify effects such as backpressure or bottlenecks in throughput and latency. Although this post briefly covers what to do with backpressure, the topic of tuning the network stack will be further examined in a future post.</description>

      <description>Since version 1.5.0, Apache Flink features a new type of state which is called Broadcast State. In this post, we explain what Broadcast State is, and show an example of how it can be applied to an application that evaluates dynamic patterns on an event stream. We walk you through the processing steps and the source code to implement this application in practice.&#xA;What is Broadcast State? # The Broadcast State can be used to combine and jointly process two streams of events in a specific way.</description>

      <guid>https://flink.apache.org/2019/06/05/a-deep-dive-into-flinks-network-stack/</guid>
      <description>Flink’s network stack is one of the core components that make up the flink-runtime module and sit at the heart of every Flink job. It connects individual work units (subtasks) from all TaskManagers. This is where your streamed-in data flows through and it is therefore crucial to the performance of your Flink job for both the throughput as well as latency you observe. In contrast to the coordination channels between TaskManagers and JobManagers which are using RPCs via Akka, the network stack between TaskManagers relies on a much lower-level API using Netty.</description>

      <description>A common requirement for many stateful streaming applications is to automatically cleanup application state for effective management of your state size, or to control how long the application state can be accessed (e.g. due to legal regulations like the GDPR). The state time-to-live (TTL) feature was initiated in Flink 1.6.0 and enabled application state cleanup and efficient state size management in Apache Flink.&#xA;In this post, we motivate the State TTL feature and discuss its use cases.</description>

      <description>Figuring out how to manage and model temporal data for effective point-in-time analysis was a longstanding battle, dating as far back as the early 80’s, that culminated with the introduction of temporal tables in the SQL standard in 2011. Up to that point, users were doomed to implement this as part of the application logic, often hurting the length of the development lifecycle as well as the maintainability of the code.</description>

      <description>The open source data technology frameworks Apache Flink and Apache Pulsar can integrate in different ways to provide elastic data processing at large scale. I recently gave a talk at Flink Forward San Francisco 2019 and presented some of the integrations between the two frameworks for batch and streaming applications. In this post, I will give a short introduction to Apache Pulsar and its differentiating elements from other messaging systems and describe the ways that Pulsar and Flink can work together to provide a seamless developer experience for elastic data processing at scale.</description>

      <description>Apache Flink was purpose-built for stateful stream processing. However, what is state in a stream processing application? I defined state and stateful stream processing in a previous blog post, and in case you need a refresher, state is defined as memory in an application&amp;rsquo;s operators that stores information about previously-seen events that you can use to influence the processing of future events.&#xA;State is a fundamental, enabling concept in stream processing required for a majority of complex use cases.</description>

      <description>Analyzing Data Streams with SQL # More and more companies are adopting stream processing and are migrating existing batch applications to streaming or implementing streaming solutions for new use cases. Many of those applications focus on analyzing streaming data. The data streams that are analyzed come from a wide variety of sources such as database transactions, clicks, sensor measurements, or IoT devices.&#xA;Apache Flink is very well suited to power streaming analytics applications because it provides support for event-time semantics, stateful exactly-once processing, and achieves high throughput and low latency at the same time.</description>

      <description>The capabilities of open source systems for distributed stream processing have evolved significantly over the last years. Initially, the first systems in the field (notably Apache Storm) provided low latency processing, but were limited to at-least-once guarantees, processing-time semantics, and rather low-level APIs. Since then, several new systems emerged and pushed the state of the art of open source stream processing in several dimensions. Today, users of Apache Flink or Apache Beam can use fluent Scala and Java APIs to implement stream processing jobs that operate in event-time with exactly-once semantics at high throughput and low latency.</description>

Initially released by the developers at Backtype in 2011 under the Eclipse open-source license, it became popular very quickly. Only shortly afterwards, Twitter acquired Backtype. Since then, Storm has been growing in popularity, is used in production at many big companies, and is the de-facto industry standard for big data stream processing.</description>

      <description>The data analysis space is witnessing an evolution from batch to stream processing for many use cases. Although batch can be handled as a special case of stream processing, analyzing never-ending streaming data often requires a shift in the mindset and comes with its own terminology (for example, “windowing” and “at-least-once”/”exactly-once” processing). This shift and the new terminology can be quite confusing for people being new to the space of stream processing.</description>

      <description>Running data-intensive code in the JVM and making it well-behaved is tricky. Systems that put billions of data objects naively onto the JVM heap face unpredictable OutOfMemoryErrors and Garbage Collection stalls. Of course, you still want to to keep your data in memory as much as possible, for speed and responsiveness of the processing applications. In that context, &amp;ldquo;off-heap&amp;rdquo; has become almost something like a magic word to solve these problems.</description>

      <description>This blog post introduces Gelly, Apache Flink&amp;rsquo;s graph-processing API and library. Flink&amp;rsquo;s native support for iterations makes it a suitable platform for large-scale graph analytics. By leveraging delta iterations, Gelly is able to map various graph processing models such as vertex-centric or gather-sum-apply to Flink dataflows.&#xA;Gelly allows Flink users to perform end-to-end data analysis in a single system. Gelly can be seamlessly used with Flink&amp;rsquo;s DataSet API, which means that pre-processing, graph creation, analysis, and post-processing can be done in the same application.</description>

The most well-known example is Apache Hadoop, but also newer frameworks such as Apache Spark, Apache Drill, and also Apache Flink run on JVMs. A common challenge that JVM-based data analysis engines face is to store large amounts of data in memory - both for caching and for efficient processing such as sorting and joining of data.</description>

      <description>Join Processing in Apache Flink # Joins are prevalent operations in many data processing applications. Most data processing systems feature APIs that make joining data sets very easy. However, the internal algorithms for join processing are much more involved – especially if large data sets need to be efficiently handled. Therefore, join processing serves as a good example to discuss the salient design points and implementation details of a data processing system.</description>

      <description>Apache Hadoop is an industry standard for scalable analytical data processing. Many data analysis applications have been implemented as Hadoop MapReduce jobs and run in clusters around the world. Apache Flink can be an alternative to MapReduce and improves it in many dimensions. Among other features, Flink provides much better performance and offers APIs in Java and Scala, which are very easy to use. Similar to Hadoop, Flink’s APIs provide interfaces for Mapper and Reducer functions, as well as Input- and OutputFormats along with many more operators.</description>
