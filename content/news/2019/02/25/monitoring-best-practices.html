<p>This blog post provides an introduction to Apache Flink’s built-in monitoring
and metrics system, that allows developers to effectively monitor their Flink
jobs. Oftentimes, the task of picking the relevant metrics to monitor a
Flink application can be overwhelming for a DevOps team that is just starting
with stream processing and Apache Flink. Having worked with many organizations
that deploy Flink at scale, I would like to share my experience and some best
practice with the community.</p>

<p>With business-critical applications running on Apache Flink, performance monitoring
becomes an increasingly important part of a successful production deployment. It 
ensures that any degradation or downtime is immediately identified and resolved
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Monitoring goes hand-in-hand with observability, which is a prerequisite for
troubleshooting and performance tuning. Nowadays, with the complexity of modern
enterprise applications and the speed of delivery increasing, an engineering
team must understand and have a complete overview of its applications’ status at
any given point in time.</p>

<h2 id="flinks-metrics-system">Flink’s Metrics System</h2>

<p>The foundation for monitoring Flink jobs is its <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html">metrics
system</a>
which consists of two components; <code>Metrics</code> and <code>MetricsReporters</code>.</p>

<h3 id="metrics">Metrics</h3>

<p>Flink comes with a comprehensive set of built-in metrics such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Used JVM Heap / NonHeap / Direct Memory (per Task-/JobManager)</li>
  <li>Number of Job Restarts (per Job)</li>
  <li>Number of Records Per Second (per Operator)</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>These metrics have different scopes and measure more general (e.g. JVM or
operating system) as well as Flink-specific aspects.</p>

<p>As a user, you can and should add application-specific metrics to your
functions. Typically these include counters for the number of invalid records or
the number of records temporarily buffered in managed state. Besides counters,
Flink offers additional metrics types like gauges and histograms. For
instructions on how to register your own metrics with Flink’s metrics system
please check out <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html#registering-metrics">Flink’s
documentation</a>.
In this blog post, we will focus on how to get the most out of Flink’s built-in
metrics.</p>

<h3 id="metricsreporters">MetricsReporters</h3>

<p>All metrics can be queried via Flink’s REST API. However, users can configure
MetricsReporters to send the metrics to external systems. Apache Flink provides
reporters to the most common monitoring tools out-of-the-box including JMX,
Prometheus, Datadog, Graphite and InfluxDB. For information about how to
configure a reporter check out Flink’s <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html#reporter">MetricsReporter
documentation</a>.</p>

<p>In the remaining part of this blog post, we will go over some of the most
important metrics to monitor your Apache Flink application.</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-general-health">Monitoring General Health</h2>

<p>The first thing you want to monitor is whether your job is actually in a <em>RUNNING</em>
state. In addition, it pays off to monitor the number of restarts and the time
since the last restart.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, successful checkpointing is a strong indicator of the
general health of your application. For each checkpoint, checkpoint barriers
need to flow through the whole topology of your Flink job and events and
barriers cannot overtake each other. Therefore, a successful checkpoint shows
that no channel is fully congested.</p>

<h2 id="monitoring-progress--throughput">Monitoring Progress &amp; Throughput</h2>

<p>Knowing that your application is RUNNING and checkpointing is working fine is good,
but it does not tell you whether the application is actually making progress and
keeping up with the upstream systems.</p>

<h3 id="throughput">Throughput</h3>

<p>Flink provides multiple metrics to measure the throughput of our application.
For each operator or task (remember: a task can contain multiple <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/dev/stream/operators/#task-chaining-and-resource-groups">chained
tasks</a>
Flink counts the number of records and bytes going in and out. Out of those
metrics, the rate of outgoing records per operator is often the most intuitive
and easiest to reason about.</p>

<p><strong>Key Metrics</strong></p>

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Metric</th>
      <th>Scope</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td><code>numRecordsOutPerSecond</code></td>
      <td>task</td>
      <td>The number of records this operator/task sends per second.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>numRecordsOutPerSecond</code></td>
      <td>operator</td>
      <td>The number of records this operator sends per second.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<i><small>Mean Records Out per Second per Operator</small></i>
</center>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Possible Alerts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>recordsOutPerSecond</code> = <code>0</code> (for a non-Sink operator)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note</em>: Source operators always have zero incoming records. Sink operators
always have zero outgoing records because the metrics only count
Flink-internal communication. There is a <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-7286">JIRA
ticket</a> to change this
behavior.</p>

<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>For applications, that use event time semantics, it is important that watermarks
progress over time. A watermark of time <em>t</em> tells the framework, that it
should not anymore expect to receive  events with a timestamp earlier than <em>t</em>,
and in turn, to trigger all operations that were scheduled for a timestamp &lt; <em>t</em>.
For example, an event time window that ends at <em>t</em> = 30 will be closed and
evaluated once the watermark passes 30.</p>

<p>As a consequence, you should monitor the watermark at event time-sensitive
operators in your application, such as process functions and windows. If the
difference between the current processing time and the watermark, known as
even-time skew, is unusually high, then it typically implies one of two issues.
First, it could mean that your are simply processing old events, for example
during catch-up after a downtime or when your job is simply not able to keep up
and events are queuing up. Second, it could mean a single upstream sub-task has
not sent a watermark for a long time (for example because it did not receive any
events to base the watermark on), which also prevents the watermark in
downstream operators to progress. This <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-5017">JIRA
ticket</a> provides further
information and a work around for the latter.</p>

<h3 id="keeping-up">“Keeping Up”</h3>

<p>When consuming from a message queue, there is often a direct way to monitor if
your application is keeping up. By using connector-specific metrics you can
monitor how far behind the head of the message queue your current consumer group
is. Flink forwards the underlying metrics from most sources.</p>

      <td>user</td>
      <td>applies to <code>FlinkKinesisConsumer</code>. The number of milliseconds a consumer is behind the head of the stream. For any consumer and Kinesis shard, this indicates how far it is behind the current time.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Possible Alerts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>records-lag-max</code>  &gt; <code>threshold</code></li>
  <li><code>millisBehindLatest</code> &gt; <code>threshold</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="monitoring-latency">Monitoring Latency</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, latency is the delay between the creation of an event and
the time at which results based on this event become visible. Once the event is
created it is usually stored in a persistent message queue, before it is
processed by Apache Flink, which then writes the results to a database or calls
a downstream system. In such a pipeline, latency can be introduced at each stage
and for various reasons including the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>It might take a varying amount of time until events are persisted in the
message queue.</li>
  <li>During periods of high load or during recovery, events might spend some time
in the message queue until they are processed by Flink (see previous section).</li>
  <li>Some operators in a streaming topology need to buffer events for some time
(e.g. in a time window) for functional reasons.</li>
  <li>Each computation in your Flink topology (framework or user code), as well as
each network shuffle, takes time and adds to latency.</li>
  <li>If the application emits through a transactional sink, the sink will only
commit and publish transactions upon successful checkpoints of Flink, adding
latency usually up to the checkpointing interval for each record.</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, it has proven invaluable to add timestamps to your events at
multiple stages (at least at creation, persistence, ingestion by Flink,
publication by Flink, possibly sampling those to save bandwidth). The
differences between these timestamps can be exposed as a user-defined metric in
your Flink topology to derive the latency distribution of each stage.</p>

<p>In the rest of this section, we will only consider latency, which is introduced
inside the Flink topology and cannot be attributed to transactional sinks or
events being buffered for functional reasons (4.).</p>

<p>To this end, Flink comes with a feature called <a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html#latency-tracking">Latency
Tracking</a>.
When enabled, Flink will insert so-called latency markers periodically at all
sources. For each sub-task, a latency distribution from each source to this
operator will be reported. The granularity of these histograms can be further
controlled by setting <em>metrics.latency.granularity</em> as desired.</p>

<p>Due to the potentially high number of histograms (in particular for
<em>metrics.latency.granularity: subtask</em>), enabling latency tracking can
significantly impact the performance of the cluster. It is recommended to only
enable it to locate sources of latency during debugging.</p>

<h2 id="jvm-metrics">JVM Metrics</h2>

<p>So far we have only looked at Flink-specific metrics. As long as latency &amp;
throughput of your application are in line with your expectations and it is
checkpointing consistently, this is probably everything you need. On the other
hand, if you job’s performance is starting to degrade among the firstmetrics you
want to look at are memory consumption and CPU load of your Task- &amp; JobManager
JVMs.</p>

<h3 id="memory">Memory</h3>

<p>Flink reports the usage of Heap, NonHeap, Direct &amp; Mapped memory for JobManagers
and TaskManagers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Heap memory - as with most JVM applications - is the most volatile and important
metric to watch. This is especially true when using Flink’s filesystem
statebackend as it keeps all state objects on the JVM Heap. If the size of
long-living objects on the Heap increases significantly, this can usually be
attributed to the size of your application state (check the 
<a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html#checkpointing">checkpointing metrics</a>
for an estimated size of the on-heap state). The possible reasons for growing
state are very application-specific. Typically, an increasing number of keys, a
large event-time skew between different input streams or simply missing state
cleanup may cause growing state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>NonHeap memory is dominated by the metaspace, the size of which is unlimited by default
and holds class metadata as well as static content. There is a 
<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-10317">JIRA Ticket</a> to limit the size
to 250 megabyte by default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The biggest driver of Direct memory is by far the
number of Flink’s network buffers, which can be
<a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/ops/config.html#configuring-the-network-buffers">configured</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mapped memory is usually close to zero as Flink does not use memory-mapped files.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In a containerized environment you should additionally monitor the overall
memory consumption of the Job- and TaskManager containers to ensure they don’t
exceed their resource limits. This is particularly important, when using the
RocksDB statebackend, since RocksDB allocates a considerable amount of
memory off heap. To understand how much memory RocksDB might use, you can

<p><strong>Possible Alerts</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code>container memory limit</code> &lt; <code>container memory + safety margin</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cpu">CPU</h3>

<p>Besides memory, you should also monitor the CPU load of the TaskManagers. If
your TaskManagers are constantly under very high load, you might be able to
improve the overall performance by decreasing the number of task slots per
TaskManager (in case of a Standalone setup), by providing more resources to the
TaskManager (in case of a containerized setup), or by providing more
TaskManagers. In general, a system already running under very high load during
normal operations, will need much more time to catch-up after recovering from a
downtime. During this time you will see a much higher latency (event-time skew) than
usual.</p>

<p>A sudden increase in the CPU load might also be attributed to high garbage
collection pressure, which should be visible in the JVM memory metrics as well.</p>

<p>If one or a few TaskManagers are constantly under very high load, this can slow
down the whole topology due to long checkpoint alignment times and increasing
event-time skew. A common reason is skew in the partition key of the data, which
can be mitigated by pre-aggregating before the shuffle or keying on a more
evenly distributed key.</p>

<h2 id="system-resources">System Resources</h2>

<p>In addition to the JVM metrics above, it is also possible to use Flink’s metrics
system to gather insights about system resources, i.e. memory, CPU &amp;
network-related metrics for the whole machine as opposed to the Flink processes
alone. System resource monitoring is disabled by default and requires additional
dependencies on the classpath. Please check out the 
<a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html#system-resources">Flink system resource metrics documentation</a> for
additional guidance and details. System resource monitoring in Flink can be very
helpful in setups without existing host monitoring capabilities.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This post tries to shed some light on Flink’s metrics and monitoring system. You
can utilise it as a starting point when you first think about how to
successfully monitor your Flink application. I highly recommend to start
monitoring your Flink application early on in the development phase. This way
you will be able to improve your dashboards and alerts over time and, more
importantly, observe the performance impact of the changes to your application
throughout the development phase. By doing so, you can ask the right questions
about the runtime behaviour of your application, and learn much more about
Flink’s internals early on.</p>

<p>Last but not least, this post only scratches the surface of the overall metrics
and monitoring capabilities of Apache Flink. I highly recommend going over
<a href="https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-docs-release-1.7/monitoring/metrics.html">Flink’s metrics documentation</a>
for a full reference of Flink’s metrics system.</p>
