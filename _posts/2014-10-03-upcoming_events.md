We are happy to announce several upcoming Flink events both in Europe and the US. Starting with a **Flink hackathon in Stockholm** (Oct 8-9) and a talk about Flink at the **Stockholm Hadoop User Group** (Oct 8). This is followed by the very first **Flink Meetup in Berlin** (Oct 15). In the US, there will be two Flink Meetup talks: the first one at the **Pasadena Big Data User Group** (Oct 29) and the second one at **Silicon Valley Hands On Programming Events** (Nov 4).

We are looking forward to seeing you at any of these events. The following is an overview of each event and links to the respective Meetup pages.

### Flink Hackathon, Stockholm (Oct 8-9)

The hackathon will take place at KTH/SICS from Oct 8th-9th. You can sign up here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDZnMlRtZHJ3Z0hVTlFZVjU2MWtoX0E6MA.

Here is a rough agenda and a list of topics to work upon or look into. Suggestions and more topics are welcome.

10:15 - 11:00 Introduction to the topics (Streaming API and system by Gyula
& Marton), (Graphs by Vasia / Martin / Stephan)

11:00 - 12:30 Happy hacking (part 1)

12:30 - Lunch (Food will be provided by KTH / SICS. A big thank you to them
and also to Paris, for organizing that)

13:xx - Happy hacking (part 2)

#### Thursday (9th)

Happy hacking (continued)


#### Suggestions for topics

##### Streaming

 - Sample streaming applications (e.g. continuous heavy hitters and topics
on the twitter stream)

 - Implement a simple SQL to Streaming program parser. Possibly using
Apache Calcite (http://optiq.incubator.apache.org/)

 - Implement different windowing methods (count-based, time-based, ...)

 - Implement different windowed operations (windowed-stream-join,
windowed-stream-co-group)

 - Streaming state, and interaction with other programs (that access state
of a stream program)

##### Graph Analysis

 - Prototype a Graph DSL (simple graph building, filters, graph
properties, some algorithms)

 - Prototype abstractions different Graph processing paradigms
(vertex-centric, partition-centric).

 - Generalize the delta iterations, allow flexible state access.

### Meetup: Hadoop User Group Talk, Stockholm (Oct 8)
