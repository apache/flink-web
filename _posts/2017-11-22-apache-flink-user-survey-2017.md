<p>All members of the Apache Flink community are invited to participate in the <a href="http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3166399/Apache-Flink-User-Survey-f2c5ebace72c" target='_blank'><small><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-new-window"></span></small>second-annual Flink user survey.</a>

This survey will help the community to shape the Flink roadmap and to make Flink the best that it can be for users.

A report with a summary of findings will be published at the conclusion of the survey. All of your responses will remain confidential, and only aggregate statistics will be shared.

The survey will take approximately 5-10 minutes to complete, and almost all questions are optional--we appreciate any feedback that you're willing to provide. We plan to keep the survey open for responses until next Monday, November 27.

As a thank you, respondents can be entered in a drawing to win one of 10 passes to Flink Forward 2018 (your choice of the second-annual San Francisco event on April 9-10 or the Berlin event on September 3-5).

We hope to hear from you.
