The Apache Flink community released the second bugfix release of the Stateful Functions (StateFun) 2.2 series, version 2.2.2.

The most important change of this bugfix release is upgrading Apache Flink to version 1.11.3. In addition to many stability
fixes to the Flink runtime itself, this also allows StateFun applications to safely use savepoints to upgrade from
older versions earlier than StateFun 2.2.1. Previously, restoring from savepoints could have failed under
[certain conditions](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-19741).

<b><i>We strongly recommend all users to upgrade to 2.2.2</i></b>.
