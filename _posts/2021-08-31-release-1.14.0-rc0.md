Dear Flink Community,

we are excited to announce the first release candidate of Apache Flink 1.14. ðŸŽ‰

There are a lot of features and fixes - improving
the unified batch and streaming experience, increased the fault tolerance by 
reducing the in-flight data, worked on connectors,.... as well as tidied some 
components, just to mention some - that went into this release and it wouldn't
have been possible without your help. :) 

[Around 50 people]((https://github.com/apache/flink/graphs/contributors?from=2021-03-31&to=2021-08-31&type=c) ) have made contributions!
Two weeks ago (August 16th) we created a feature freeze. This means that only a 
few small, almost-ready features will go into the release from this moment on.
We are now in the process of stabilizing the release and need your help! As you can
see on the [1.14 release page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/1.14+Release), 
a lot of focus is on documentation and testing.

If you would like to contribute to the squirrel community, a great way would be to
download the [release candidate](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/flink/flink-1.14.0-rc0/)
and test it. You can run some existing Flink jobs or pick one of the 
[test issues](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=468&quickFilter=2115).
We would greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide on the 
[JIRA tickets](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/FLINK/summary) or on 
the [mailing list](https://flink.apache.org/gettinghelp.html#user-mailing-list).

We continue to be grateful and inspired by the community who believe in the project and want to help create a great user experience and product for all Flink users.

Many thanks!
