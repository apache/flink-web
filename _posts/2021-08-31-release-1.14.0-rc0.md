Dear Flink Community,

We are happy to announce the first release candidate of Apache Flink 1.14. ðŸŽ‰ 

A lot of work from the community went into this release. We worked on improving
the unified batch and streaming experience, increased the fault tolerance by 
reducing the in-flight data, worked on connectors,.... as well as tidied some 
components.

The development cycle is now entering the phase of stabilising the release
and making it a good, coherent experience for Apache Flink users.

Thatâ€™s when we want to ask you for help. As you can see on the 
[1.14. release page](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/1.14+Release)
a lot of focus went in documentation and testing. We want to ask our users now to 
get the release candidate and test it, by e.g. running some existing Flink jobs 
on the release candidate or picking one of the testing issues.

How can you help:

* Get Apache Flink 1.14. release candidate here
  * The [preview source release and binary convenience releases](https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/flink/flink-1.14.0-rc0/),
