April was an packed month for Apache Flink. 

### Flink runner for Google Cloud Dataflow

A Flink runner for Google Cloud Dataflow was announced. See the blog
posts by [data Artisans](http://data-artisans.com/announcing-google-cloud-dataflow-on-flink-and-easy-flink-deployment-on-google-cloud/) and
the [Google Cloud Platform Blog](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.de/2015/03/announcing-Google-Cloud-Dataflow-runner-for-Apache-Flink.html).
Google Cloud Dataflow programs can be written using and open-source
SDK and run in multiple backends, either as a managed service inside
Google's infrastructure, or leveraging open source runners,
including Apache Flink.


## Flink 0.9.0-milestone1 release

The highlight of April was of course the availability of [Flink 0.9-milestone1]({{site.baseurl}}/news/2015/04/13/release-0.9.0-milestone1.html). This was a release packed with new features, including, a Python DataSet API, the new SQL-like Table API, FlinkML, a machine learning library on Flink, Gelly, FLink's Graph API, as well as a mode to run Flink on YARN leveraging Tez.

## Conferences and meetups

April kicked off the conference season. Apache Flink was presented at ApacheCon in Texas ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/fhueske/apache-flink)), the Hadoop Summit in Brussels featured two talks on Flink (see slides [here](http://www.slideshare.net/AljoschaKrettek/data-analysis-with-apache-flink-hadoop-summit-2015) and [here](http://www.slideshare.net/GyulaFra/flink-streaming-hadoopsummit)), as well as at the Hadoop User Groups of the Netherlands ([slides](http://www.slideshare.net/stephanewen1/apache-flink-overview-and-use-cases-at-prehadoop-summit-meetups)) and Stockholm. The brand new [Apache Flink meetup Stockholm](http://www.meetup.com/Apache-Flink-Stockholm/) was also established.

## Google Summer of Code

Three students will work on Flink during Google's [Summer of Code program](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015) on distributed pattern matching, exact and approximate statistics for data streams and windows, as well as asynchronous iterations and updates.

## Flink on the web
