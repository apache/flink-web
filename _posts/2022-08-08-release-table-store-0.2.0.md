<!-- improve style of tables -->
<style>
  table { border: 0px solid black; table-layout: auto; width: 800px; }
  th, td { border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; }

The Apache Flink community is pleased to announce the release of the
[Apache Flink Table Store](https://github.com/apache/flink-table-store) (0.2.0).

Please check out the full [documentation]({{site.DOCS_BASE_URL}}flink-table-store-docs-release-0.2/) for detailed information and user guides.

## What is Flink Table Store

Flink Table Store is a data lake storage for streaming updates/deletes changelog ingestion and high-performance queries in real time.

</center>

As a new type of updatable data lake, Flink Table Store has the following features:

* Large throughput data ingestion while offering good query performance.
* High performance query with primary key filters, as fast as 100ms.
* Streaming reads are available on Lake Storage, lake storage can also be integrated
with Kafka to provide second-level streaming reads.

## Notable Features

In this release, we have accomplished many exciting features.

### Catalog

This release introduces Table Store's own catalog and supports automatic synchronization to the Hive Metastore.

```sql
CREATE CATALOG tablestore WITH (
  'type'='table-store',
  'warehouse'='hdfs://nn:8020/warehouse/path',
  -- optional hive metastore
  'metastore'='hive',
  'uri'='thrift://<hive-metastore-host-name>:<port>'
);

USE CATALOG tablestore;

CREATE TABLE my_table ...
```

### Ecosystem

In this release, we provide support for Flink 1.14 and provide read support for multiple compute engines.

 Engine    | Version  | Feature     |    Read Pushdown   |
---------- | -------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
 Flink     | 1.14     | read, write | Projection, Filter |
 Flink     | 1.15     | read, write | Projection, Filter |
 Hive      | 2.3      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Spark     | 2.4      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Spark     | 3.0      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Spark     | 3.1      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Spark     | 3.2      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Spark     | 3.3      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Trino     | 358      | read        | Projection, Filter |
 Trino     | 388      | read        | Projection, Filter |

### Append-only

The append-only table feature is a performance improvement and only accepts INSERT_ONLY data to append to the storage
instead of updating or de-duplicating the existing data, and hence suitable for use cases that do not
require updates (such as log data synchronization).

```sql
CREATE TABLE my_table (
    ...
) WITH (
    'write-mode' = 'append-only',
    ...
)
```

Streaming writing to an Append-only table also has asynchronous compaction, so you don't have to
worry about small files.

### Rescale Bucket

Since the number of total buckets dramatically influences the performance, Table Store allows
users to tune bucket numbers by `ALTER TABLE` command and reorganize necessary partitions,
the old partitions remain unchanged.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [getting started guide]({{site.DOCS_BASE_URL}}flink-table-store-docs-release-0.2/docs/try-table-store/quick-start/) for more details.

<br/>

## What's Next?

In the upcoming 0.3.0 release you can expect the following additional features:

* Streaming Changelog Concurrent Writes, the separation of Compaction.
* Aggregation Table, to build your materialized view.
* Changelog producing for partial-update/aggregation Tables.
* Full Schema Evolution supports for drop column and rename column.
* Lookup Supports for Flink Dim Join.

Please give the release a try, share your feedback on the Flink mailing list and contribute to the project!
