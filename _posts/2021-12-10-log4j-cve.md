Yesterday, a new Zero Day for Apache Log4j was [reported](https://www.cyberkendra.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-vulnerability-details-and.html). 
It is by now tracked under [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). 

Apache Flink is bundling a version of Log4j that is affeced by this vulnerability. 
We recommend users to follow the [adivsory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) of the Apache Log4j Community. 
For Apache Flink this currently translates to "setting system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`" until Log4j has been upgraded to 2.15.0 in Apache Flink. 

This effort is tracked in [FLINK-25240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25240). 
It will be included in Flink 1.15.0, Flink 1.14.1 and Flink 1.13.3.
We expect Flink 1.14.1 to be released in the next 1-2 weeks.
The other releases will follow in their regular cadence.
