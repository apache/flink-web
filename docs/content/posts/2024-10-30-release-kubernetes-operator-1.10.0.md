The Apache Flink community is excited to announce the release of Flink Kubernetes Operator 1.10.0!

The release includes several improvements to the autoscaler, and introduces a new Kubernetes custom resource called FlinkStateSnapshot to manage job snapshots.
The process of job upgrades has also been enhanced which makes it possible to now use the last-state upgrade mode with session jobs.

We encourage you to [download the release](https://flink.apache.org/downloads.html) and share your experience with the
community through the Flink [mailing lists](https://flink.apache.org/community.html#mailing-lists) or
[JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/flink)! We're looking forward to your feedback!

## Highlights

### FlinkStateSnapshot

With this version comes also a new custom resource called FlinkStateSnapshot. 
This is used to describe savepoint or checkpoint for a Flink job. 
The savepoint/checkpoint fields found in FlinkDeployment and FlinkSessionJob status are therefore deprecated, and the operator will create new FlinkStateSnapshot resources for periodic, update and manual savepoints/checkpoints.

Users can also create new FlinkStateSnapshot resources, which will instruct the operator to trigger new checkpoint/savepoint.

This new feature is enabled by default, unless disabled by setting `kubernetes.operator.snapshot.resource.enabled` to false or if the FlinkStateSnapshot CRD was not found on the Kubernetes cluster.

You can read more about this feature [here](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-release-1.10/docs/custom-resource/snapshots/).


### Last-State Upgrade Mode

For deployments using last-state upgrade mode, the operator - instead of forcefully deleting the JobManager pods to trigger a restart - will cancel the job via REST API and extract the last checkpoint info after cancellation if the job is healthy.
This change makes it possible to finally use the last-state upgrade mode for session jobs as well.


### Autoscaler Scale Down

With the introduction of the configuration option `job.autoscaler.scale-down.interval`, the operator can now optimize multiple scale-down operations to a single one to prevent too many unnecessary downscales, thus improving job availability.
Please note that `job.autoscaler.scale-up.grace-period` has been removed with this change.


### Other Autoscaler Improvements
- Autoscaling now takes into account the number of partitions in case of Kafka and Pulsar
- Better error handling
- Introduced `autoscaler.standalone.jdbc.event-handler.ttl` to support cleaning up historical event handler records in JDBC event handler
- Autoscaler is now compatible with Flink 1.20
