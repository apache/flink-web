title: Announcing the Release of Apache Flink 1.19
aliases:
- /news/2024/03/18/release-1.19.0.html
---

The Apache Flink PMC is pleased to announce the release of Apache Flink 1.19.0. As usual, we are
looking at a packed release with a wide variety of improvements and new features. Overall, 162
people contributed to this release completing 33 FLIPs and 600+ issues. Thank you!

Let's dive into the highlights.

# Flink SQL Improvements

## Custom Parallelism for Table/SQL Sources

Now in Flink 1.19, you can set a custom parallelism for performance tuning via the `scan.parallelism`
option. The first available connector is DataGen (Kafka connector is on the way). Here is an example
using SQL Client:

```sql
-- set parallelism within the ddl
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    order_number BIGINT,
    price        DECIMAL(32,2),
    buyer        ROW<first_name STRING, last_name STRING>,
    order_time   TIMESTAMP(3)
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'datagen',
    'scan.parallelism' = '4'
);

-- or set parallelism via dynamic table option
SELECT * FROM Orders /*+ OPTIONS('scan.parallelism'='4') */;
```

* [FLIP-367: Support Setting Parallelism for Table/SQL Sources](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=263429150)


## Configurable SQL Gateway Java Options

A new option `env.java.opts.sql-gateway` for specifying the Java options is introduced in Flink 1.19,
so you can fine-tune the memory settings, garbage collection behavior, and other relevant Java
parameters for SQL Gateway.

**More Information**
* [FLINK-33203](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33203)


## Configure Different State TTLs Using SQL Hint

Starting from Flink 1.18, Table API and SQL users can set state time-to-live (TTL) individually for
stateful operators via the SQL compiled plan. In Flink 1.19, users have a more flexible way to
specify custom TTL values for regular joins and group aggregations directly within their queries by [utilizing the STATE_TTL hint](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/hints/#state-ttl-hints).
This improvement means that you no longer need to alter your compiled plan to set specific TTLs for
these frequently used operators. With the introduction of `STATE_TTL` hints, you can streamline your workflow and
dynamically adjust the TTL based on your operational requirements.

Here is an example:
```sql
-- set state ttl for join
SELECT /*+ STATE_TTL('Orders'= '1d', 'Customers' = '20d') */ *
FROM Orders LEFT OUTER JOIN Customers
    ON Orders.o_custkey = Customers.c_custkey;

-- set state ttl for aggregation
SELECT /*+ STATE_TTL('o' = '1d') */ o_orderkey, SUM(o_totalprice) AS revenue
FROM Orders AS o
GROUP BY o_orderkey;
```

* [FLIP-373: Support Configuring Different State TTLs using SQL Hint](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-373%3A+Support+Configuring+Different+State+TTLs+using+SQL+Hint)


## Named Parameters for Functions and Procedures

Named parameters now can be used when calling a function or stored procedure. With named parameters,
users do not need to strictly specify the parameter position, just specify the parameter name and its
corresponding value. At the same time, if non-essential parameters are not specified, they will default to being filled with null.

Here's an example of defining a function with one mandatory parameter and two optional parameters using named parameters:
```java
public static class NamedArgumentsTableFunction extends TableFunction<Object> {

	@FunctionHint(
			output = @DataTypeHint("STRING"),
			arguments = {
					@ArgumentHint(name = "in1", isOptional = false, type = @DataTypeHint("STRING")),
					@ArgumentHint(name = "in2", isOptional = true, type = @DataTypeHint("STRING")),
					@ArgumentHint(name = "in3", isOptional = true, type = @DataTypeHint("STRING"))})
	public void eval(String arg1, String arg2, String arg3) {
		collect(arg1 + ", " + arg2 + "," + arg3);
	}

}
```
When calling the function in SQL, parameters can be specified by name, for example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(myFunction(in1 => 'v1', in3 => 'v3', in2 => 'v2'));
```
Also the optional parameters can be omitted:
```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE(myFunction(in1 => 'v1'));
```

## Window TVF Aggregation Features

* Supports SESSION Window TVF in Streaming Mode<br />
Now users can use SESSION Window TVF in streaming mode. A simple example is as follows:
```sql
-- session window with partition keys
SELECT * FROM TABLE(
   SESSION(TABLE Bid PARTITION BY item, DESCRIPTOR(bidtime), INTERVAL '5' MINUTES));

-- apply aggregation on the session windowed table with partition keys
SELECT window_start, window_end, item, SUM(price) AS total_price
FROM TABLE(
    SESSION(TABLE Bid PARTITION BY item, DESCRIPTOR(bidtime), INTERVAL '5' MINUTES))
GROUP BY item, window_start, window_end;
```
* Supports Changelog Inputs for Window TVF Aggregation<br />
  Window aggregation operators (generated based on Window TVF Function) can now handle changelog
  streams (e.g., CDC data sources, etc.). Users are recommended to migrate from legacy window
  aggregation to the new syntax for more complete feature support.

**More Information**
* [Documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/dev/table/sql/queries/window-tvf/#session)

## New UDF Type: AsyncScalarFunction

The common UDF type `ScalarFunction` works well for CPU-intensive operations, but less well for IO
bound or otherwise long-running computations. In Flink 1.19, we have a new `AsyncScalarFunction` 
which is a user-defined asynchronous `ScalarFunction` allows for issuing concurrent function calls
asynchronously.

* [FLIP-400: AsyncScalarFunction for asynchronous scalar function support](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-400%3A+AsyncScalarFunction+for+asynchronous+scalar+function+support)

## Tuning: MiniBatch Optimization for Regular Joins

The record amplification is a pain point when performing cascading joins in Flink, now in Flink 1.19,
the new mini-batch optimization can be used for regular join to reduce intermediate result in such
cascading join scenarios.

# Runtime & Coordination Improvements

## Dynamic Source Parallelism Inference for Batch Jobs

In Flink 1.19, we have supported dynamic source parallelism inference for batch jobs, which allows
source connectors to dynamically infer the parallelism based on the actual amount of data to consume.
This feature is a significant improvement over previous versions, which only assigned a fixed default
parallelism to source vertices.
Source connectors need to implement the inference interface to enable dynamic parallelism inference.
Currently, the FileSource connector has already been developed with this functionality in place.
Additionally, the configuration `execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.default-source-parallelism`
will be used as the upper bound of source parallelism inference. And now it will not default to 1.
Instead, if it is not set, the upper bound of allowed parallelism set via
`execution.batch.adaptive.auto-parallelism.max-parallelism` will be used. If that configuration is
also not set, the default parallelism set via `parallelism.default` or `StreamExecutionEnvironment#setParallelism()`
will be used instead.

* [FLIP-379: Support dynamic source parallelism inference for batch jobs](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-379%3A+Dynamic+source+parallelism+inference+for+batch+jobs)

## Standard YAML for Flink Configuration

Starting with Flink 1.19, Flink has officially introduced full support for the standard YAML 1.2
syntax. The default configuration file has been changed to `config.yaml` and placed in the `conf/`
directory. Users should directly modify this file to configure Flink.
If users want to use the legacy configuration file `flink-conf.yaml`, users just need to copy this
file into the `conf/` directory. Once the legacy configuration file `flink-conf.yaml` is detected,
Flink will prioritize using it as the configuration file. And in the upcoming Flink 2.0, the
`flink-conf.yaml` configuration file will no longer work.

## Profiling JobManager/TaskManager on Flink Web

In Flink 1.19, we support triggering profiling at the JobManager/TaskManager level, allowing users to
create a profiling instance with arbitrary intervals and event modes (supported by [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler)).
Users can easily submit profiles and export results in the Flink Web UI.

For example, users can simply submit a profiling instance with a specified period and mode by
"Creating a Profiling Instance" after identifying a candidate TaskManager/JobManager with a
performance bottleneck:
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="/img/blog/2024-03-18-release-1.19.0/profiling.png" style="width:90%;margin:15px">
</div>

then easily download the interactive HTML file after the profiling instance is complete:

* [FLIP-375: Built-in cross-platform powerful java profiler](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/x/64lEE)

## New Config Options for Administrator JVM Options

A set of administrator JVM options are available, which prepend the user-set extra JVM options for
platform-wide JVM tuning.

* [FLIP-397: Add config options for administrator JVM options](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-397%3A+Add+config+options+for+administrator+JVM+options?src=jira)

## Beta Support for Java 21

Apache Flink was made ready to compile and run with Java 21. This feature is still in beta mode.
Issues should be reported in Flink's bug tracker.

* [FLINK-33163](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33163)

# Checkpoints Improvements

## Using Larger Checkpointing Interval When Source is Processing Backlog

`IsProcessingBacklog` is introduced to indicate whether a record should be processed with low latency
or high throughput. Connector developers can update the Source implementation to utilize the
`SplitEnumeratorContext#setIsProcessingBacklog` method to report whether the records are backlog records.
Users can set the `execution.checkpointing.interval-during-backlog` to use a larger checkpoint interval
to enhance the throughput while the job is processing backlog if the source is backlog-aware.

**More Information**
* [FLINK-32514](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32514)
* [FLIP-309: Support using larger checkpointing interval when source is processing backlog](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-309%3A+Support+using+larger+checkpointing+interval+when+source+is+processing+backlog)

## CheckpointsCleaner Clean Individual Checkpoint States in Parallel

Now when disposing of no longer needed checkpoints, every state handle/state file will be disposed
in parallel by the ioExecutor, vastly improving the disposing speed of a single checkpoint (for
large checkpoints the disposal time can be improved from 10 minutes to < 1 minute) . The old
behavior can be restored by setting `state.checkpoint.cleaner.parallel-mode` to false.

**More Information**
* [FLINK-33090](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-33090)

## Trigger Checkpoints through Command Line Client

The command line interface supports triggering a checkpoint manually. Usage:
```shell
./bin/flink checkpoint $JOB_ID [-full]
```
By specifying the '-full' option, a full checkpoint is triggered. Otherwise an incremental
checkpoint is triggered if the job is configured to take incremental ones periodically.

# Connector API Improvements

## New Interfaces to SinkV2 That Are Consistent with Source API

In Flink 1.19, the SinkV2 API made some changes to align with Source API.<br />
The following interfaces are deprecated: `TwoPhaseCommittingSink`, `StatefulSink`, `WithPreWriteTopology`, `WithPreCommitTopology`, `WithPostCommitTopology`.<br />
The following new interfaces have been introduced: `CommitterInitContext`, `CommittingSinkWriter`, `WriterInitContext`, `StatefulSinkWriter`.<br />
The following interface method's parameter has been changed: `Sink#createWriter`.<br />
The original interfaces will remain available during the 1.19 release line, but they will be removed
in consecutive releases.

## New Committer Metrics to Track the Status of Committables

The `TwoPhaseCommittingSink#createCommitter` method parameterization has been changed, a new
`CommitterInitContext` parameter has been added. The original method will remain available during
the 1.19 release line, but they will be removed in consecutive releases.

**More Information**

# Important Deprecations

In preparation for the release of Flink 2.0 later this year, the community has decided to officially
deprecate multiple APIs that were approaching end of life for a while.

* Flink's [`org.apache.flink.api.common.time.Time`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/time/Time.java) is now officially deprecated and will be dropped in Flink 2.0
Please migrate it to Java's own `Duration` class. Methods supporting the `Duration` class that replace the deprecated `Time`-based methods were introduced.
* [`org.apache.flink.runtime.jobgraph.RestoreMode#LEGACY`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/jobgraph/RestoreMode.java#L40) is deprecated. Please use [`RestoreMode#CLAIM`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/jobgraph/RestoreMode.java#L31) or [`RestoreMode#NO_CLAIM`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-runtime/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/runtime/jobgraph/RestoreMode.java#L34) mode instead to get a clear state file ownership when restoring.
* The old method of resolving schema compatibility has been deprecated, please migrate to the new method following [Migrating from deprecated `TypeSerializerSnapshot#resolveSchemaCompatibility(TypeSerializer newSerializer)` before Flink 1.19](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/serialization/custom_serialization/#migrating-from-deprecated-typeserializersnapshotresolveschemacompatibilityt).
* Configuring serialization behavior through hard codes is deprecated, e.g., [`ExecutionConfig#enableForceKryo()`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/ExecutionConfig.java#L643). Please use the options
`pipeline.serialization-config`, `pipeline.force-avro`, `pipeline.force-kryo`, and `pipeline.generic-types`. Registration of instance-level serializers is deprecated, using class-level serializers instead.
* We have deprecated all `setXxx` and `getXxx` methods except [`getString(String key, String defaultValue)`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/configuration/Configuration.java#L176) 
and [`setString(String key, String value)`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/configuration/Configuration.java#L220), such as: `setInteger`, `setLong`, `getInteger` and `getLong` etc.
Users and developers are recommend to use get and set methods with `ConfigOption` instead of string as key.
* The non-`ConfigOption` objects in the `StreamExecutionEnvironment`, `CheckpointConfig`, and `ExecutionConfig` and their corresponding getter/setter interfaces are now be deprecated. These objects and methods are planned to be removed in Flink 2.0. The deprecated interfaces include the getter and setter methods of `RestartStrategy`, `CheckpointStorage`, and `StateBackend`.
* [`org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/functions/RuntimeContext.java#L191) is now officially deprecated and will be dropped in Flink 2.0. Please migrate all related usages to the new getter method:<br />
Migrate [`TypeInformation#createSerializer`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/typeinfo/TypeInformation.java#L201) to [`RuntimeContext#createTypeSerializer`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/functions/RuntimeContext.java#L200)<br />
Migrate `RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig.getGlobalJobParameters` to [`RuntimeContext#getGlobalJobParameters`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/functions/RuntimeContext.java#L208)<br />
Migrate `RuntimeContext#getExecutionConfig.isObjectReuseEnabled()` to [`RuntimeContext#isObjectReuseEnabled`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/functions/RuntimeContext.java#L216)
* [`org.apache.flink.api.common.functions.RichFunction#open(Configuration parameters)`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/functions/RichFunction.java#L76) method has been deprecated and will be removed in future versions.
Users are encouraged to migrate to the new [`RichFunction#open(OpenContext openContext)`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/release-1.19/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/common/functions/RichFunction.java#L118).
* [`org.apache.flink.configuration.AkkaOptions`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/configuration/AkkaOptions.java) is deprecated and replaced with [`RpcOptions`](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/configuration/RpcOptions.java).

# Upgrade Notes

The Flink community tries to ensure that upgrades are as seamless as possible.
However, certain changes may require users to make adjustments to certain parts
of the program when upgrading to version 1.19. Please refer to the
[release notes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.19/release-notes/flink-1.19/)
