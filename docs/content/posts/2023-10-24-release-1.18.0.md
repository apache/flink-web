# Towards a Streaming Lakehouse

## Flink SQL Improvements

### Introduce Flink JDBC Driver For SQL Gateway 

Flink 1.18 comes with a JDBC Driver for the Flink SQL Gateway. So, you can now use any SQL Client that supports JDBC to 
interact with your tables via Flink SQL. Here is an example using [SQLLine](https://julianhyde.github.io/sqlline/manual.html). 

```shell
sqlline> !connect jdbc:flink://localhost:8083
```

```shell
sqlline version 1.12.0
sqlline> !connect jdbc:flink://localhost:8083
Enter username for jdbc:flink://localhost:8083:
Enter password for jdbc:flink://localhost:8083:
0: jdbc:flink://localhost:8083> CREATE TABLE T(
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>      a INT,
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>      b VARCHAR(10)
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>  ) WITH (
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>      'connector' = 'filesystem',
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>      'path' = 'file:///tmp/T.csv',
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>      'format' = 'csv'
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .)>  );
No rows affected (0.122 seconds)
0: jdbc:flink://localhost:8083> INSERT INTO T VALUES (1, 'Hi'), (2, 'Hello');
+----------------------------------+
|              job id              |
+----------------------------------+
| fbade1ab4450fc57ebd5269fdf60dcfd |
+----------------------------------+
1 row selected (1.282 seconds)
0: jdbc:flink://localhost:8083> SELECT * FROM T;
+---+-------+
| a |   b   |
+---+-------+
| 1 | Hi    |
| 2 | Hello |
+---+-------+
2 rows selected (1.955 seconds)
0: jdbc:flink://localhost:8083>
```

### Stored Procedure Support for Flink Connectors

Stored procedures have been an indispensable tool in traditional databases,
offering a convenient way to encapsulate complex logic for data manipulation
and administrative tasks. They also offer the potential for enhanced
performance, since they can trigger the handling of data operations directly
within an external database. Other popular data systems like Trino and Iceberg
automate and simplify common maintenance tasks into small sets of procedures,
which greatly reduces users' administrative burden.

This new update primarily targets developers of Flink connectors, who can now
predefine custom stored procedures into connectors via the Catalog interface.
The primary benefit to users is that connector-specific tasks that previously
may have required writing custom Flink code can now be replaced with simple
calls that encapsulate, standardize, and potentially optimize the underlying
operations. Users can execute procedures using the familiar `CALL` syntax, and
discover a connector's available procedures with `SHOW PROCEDURES`. Stored
procedures within connectors improves the extensibility of Flink's SQL and
Table APIs, and should unlock smoother data access and management for users.

Users can use `CALL` to directly call built-in stored procedures provided by their catalog. For the built-in 
stored procedures in catalog, please refer to the documentation of the corresponding catalog. For example, when using 
the Apache Paimon catalog, you can use a stored procedure to trigger compaction for a table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE `paimon`.`default`.`T` (
id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY NOT ENFORCED,
dt STRING, -- format 'yyyy-MM-dd'
v STRING
);

-- use catalog before call procedures
USE CATALOG `paimon`;

-- compact the whole table using call statement
CALL sys.compact('default.T');
```

* [FLIP-311: Support Call Stored Procedure](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-311%3A+Support+Call+Stored+Procedure)

### Extended DDL Support

From this release onwards, Flink supports

- `REPLACE TABLE AS SELECT`
- `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE AS SELECT`

and both these commands and previously supported `CREATE TABLE AS` can now support atomicity provided the underlying 
connector also supports this.

Moreover, Apache Flink now supports TRUNCATE TABLE in batch execution mode. Same as before, the underlying connector needs 
to implement and provide this capability

And, finally, we have also implemented support for adding, dropping and listing partitions via

- `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION`
- `ALTER TABLE DROP PARTITION`
- `SHOW PARTITIONS`

### Time Traveling

Flink supports the time travel SQL syntax for querying historical versions of data that allows users to specify a point 
in time and retrieve the data and schema of a table as it appeared at that time. With time travel, users can easily 
analyze and compare historical versions of data.

For example, a user can query a table at a specified point in time with the following statement;

```sql 
-- Query the table `tb` for data on November 11, 2022
SELECT * FROM tb FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2022-11-11 00:00:00';
```

## Streaming Execution Improvements

### Support Operator-Level State TTL in Table API & SQL

Starting from Flink 1.18, Table API and SQL users can set state time-to-live (TTL) individually for stateful operators.
This means that for scenarios like stream regular joins, users can now set different TTLs for the left and right 
streams. In previous versions, state expiration could only be controlled at the pipeline level using the configuration 
`table.exec.state.ttl`. With the introduction of operator-level state retention, users can now optimize resource 
usage according to their specific requirements.

### Watermark Alignment and Idleness Detection in SQL

You can now configure [watermark alignment](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/datastream/event-time/generating_watermarks/#watermark-alignment) 
and [source idleness timeouts](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/datastream/event-time/generating_watermarks/#dealing-with-idle-sources) 
in [pure SQL via hints](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/concepts/time_attributes/#advanced-watermark-features). Previously, these features were only available in the DataStream API.

## Batch Execution Improvements

### Hybrid Shuffle supports Remote Storage

Hybrid Shuffle supports storing the shuffle data in remote storage. The remote storage path can be configured with the 
option `taskmanager.network.hybrid-shuffle.remote.path`. Hybrid Shuffle uses less network memory than before by 
decoupling the memory usage from the number of parallelisms, improving the stability and ease of use.

### Performance Improvements & TPC-DS Benchmark

In previous releases, the community worked extensively to improve Flink's batch processing performance, which has led to 
significant improvements. In this release cycle, community contributors continued to put significant effort into 
further improving Flink's batch performance.

#### Runtime Filter for Flink SQL

Runtime filter is a common method for optimizing Join performance. It is designed to dynamically generate filter 
conditions for certain Join queries at runtime to reduce the amount of scanned or shuffled data, avoid unnecessary I/O 
and network transmission, and speed up the query. We introduced runtime filters in Flink 1.18, and verified its 
effectiveness through the TPC-DS benchmark, and observed up to 3x speedup for some queries by enabling this feature.

#### Operator Fusion Codegen for Flink SQL

Operator Fusion Codegen improves the execution performance of a query by fusing an operator DAG into a single optimized 
operator that eliminates virtual function calls, leverages CPU registers for intermediate data and reduces the 
instruction cache miss. As a general technical optimization, we verified its effectiveness through TPC-DS, and 
only some batch operators (Calc, HashAgg, and HashJoin) completed fusion codegen support in version 1.18, getting 
significant performance gains on some query.

Note that both features are disabled by default in Flink 1.18 and the Community is looking for feedback by users before
enabling them by default. They can be enabled by using `table.optimizer.runtime-filter.enabled` and 
`table.exec.operator-fusion-codegen.enabled` respectively.

Since Flink 1.16, the Apache Flink Community has been continuously tracking the performance of its batch engine via the 
TPC-DS benchmarking framework. After significant improvements in Flink 1.17 (dynamic join-reordering, 
dynamic local aggregations), the two improvements described in the previous sections (operator fusion, runtime filters) 
lead to 14% performance improvement compared to Flink 1.17, a 54% performance improvement compared to Flink 1.16 on a 
10T dataset for partitioned tables.

# Towards Cloud-Native Elasticity

Elasticity describes the ability of a system to adapt to workload changes in a non-disruptive, ideally automatic manner.
It is a defining characteristic of cloud-native systems and for long-running streaming workloads it is particularly 
important. As such, elasticity improvements are an area of continuous investment in the Apache Flink community. 
Recent initiatives include the Kubernetes 
[Autoscaler](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-kubernetes-operator-docs-release-1.6/docs/custom-resource/autoscaler/), 
numerous improvements to rescaling performance and last but not least 
the [Adaptive Scheduler](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/deployment/elastic_scaling/#adaptive-scheduler).

The Adaptive Scheduler was first introduced in Flink 1.15 and constitutes a centerpiece of a fully-elastic 
Apache Flink deployment. At its core, it allows jobs to change their resource requirements and parallelism during 
runtime. In addition, it also adapts to the available resources in the cluster by only rescaling once the cluster can 
satisfy the minimum required resources of the job.

Until Flink 1.18, the adaptive scheduler was primarily used in
[Reactive Mode](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/deployment/elastic_scaling/#reactive-mode), 
which meant that a single job by design would always use all the available resources in the cluster. 
Please see [this blog post](https://flink.apache.org/2021/05/06/scaling-flink-automatically-with-reactive-mode/) on 
how to autoscale Flink Jobs in Reactive Mode using a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler on Kubernetes.

With Flink 1.18 the adaptive scheduler becomes much more powerful and more widely applicable and is on a trajectory to 
becoming the default scheduler for streaming workloads on Apache Flink.

## Dynamic Fine-Grained Rescaling via REST API

Despite the underlying capabilities of the Adaptive Scheduler, the ability to change the resource requirements of a 
Job during runtime has not yet been exposed to the end user directly. This changes in Flink 1.18. You can now change 
the parallelism of any individual task of your job via the Flink Web UI and REST API while the job is running.

{{< youtube B1NVDTazsZY >}}

Under the hood, Apache Flink performs a regular rescaling operation as soon as the required resources for the new 
parallelism have been acquired. The rescaling operation is not based on a Savepoint, but on an ordinary, periodic 
checkpoint, which means it does not introduce any additional snapshot. As you can see in the video above, the rescaling
operation already happens nearly instantaneously and with a very short downtime for jobs with small state size.

In conjunction with the 
[backpressure monitor](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/ops/monitoring/back_pressure/) 
of the Apache Flink Web UI, it is now easier than ever to find and maintain an efficient, backpressure-free parallelism 
for each of the tasks:

- If a task is very busy (red), you increase the parallelism.
- If a task is mostly idle (blue), you decrease the parallelism.

## Faster Rescaling with RocksDB

The rescaling times when using RocksDB Statebackend with incremental checkpoints have been improved about 30% in the 99th quantile.

We increased the potential for parallel download from just downloading state handles in parallel to downloading individual files in parallel.

Furthermore, we deactivated write-ahead-logging for batch-inserting into the temporary RocksDB instances we use for rescaling.

# Support for Java 17 

Java 17 was released in 2021 and is the latest long-term support (LTS) release of Java with an end-of-life in 2029. 
So, it was about time that Apache Flink added support for it. What does this mean concretely? As of Flink 1.18, you can
now run Apache Flink on Java 17 and the [official Docker repository](https://hub.docker.com/_/flink) includes an image 
based on Java 17.

    docker pull flink:1.18.0-java17

If your cluster runs on Java 17, this of course, also allows you to use Java 17 features in your user programs and to
compile it to a target version of Java 17.

# Others Improvements

## Production-Ready Watermark Alignment

Supported as “Beta” since Flink 1.16 and Flink 1.17, 
[watermark alignment](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/datastream/event-time/generating_watermarks/#watermark-alignment) 
has been thoroughly tested at scale in the real world. Over that time the community has collected and addressed 
bugs and performance issues as they were discovered. With the resolution of these issues, we are now happy to recommend 
watermark alignment for general use.

* [FLINK-32548](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-32548)

## Pluggable Failure Handling

Apache Flink serves as the foundation for numerous stream processing platforms at companies like Apple, Netflix or Uber. It is also the basis for various commercial stream processing services. Therefore, its ability to easily integrate into the wider ecosystem of these internal as well as vendor platforms becomes increasingly important. The catalog modification listener and pluggable failure handlers fall into this category of improvements.

* [FLIP-304: Pluggable Failure Enrichers](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/FLINK/FLIP-304%3A+Pluggable+Failure+Enrichers)

## SQL Client Quality of Life Improvements

In 1.18 the SQL Client received a collection of usability improvements: 
* The SQL Client is now more colorful with the ability to enable SQL syntax highlighting and switching among 7 different 
color schemes
* It is now easier to edit and navigate through very large queries. 
* It is now possible to turn line numbers off and on.

## Apache Pekko instead of Akka

A year ago, [Lightbend announced](https://flink.apache.org/2022/09/08/regarding-akkas-licensing-change/) changing the 
license of future versions of Akka (2.7+) from Apache 2.0 to BSL. It was also announced that Akka 2.6, the version that 
Apache Flink uses, would receive security updates and critical bug fixes until September of 2023. As September 2023 was 
approaching, we decided to switch from Akka to [Apache Pekko](https://pekko.apache.org/) (incubating). 
Apache Pekko (incubating) is a fork of Akka 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project’s adoption of the Business Source License.
Pekko recently released Apache Pekko 1.0.1-incubating, which enabled us to already use it in Flink 1.18 - just in time.
While our mid-term plan is to drop the dependency on Akka or Pekko altogether 
(see [FLINK-29281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-29281)), the switch to Pekko presents a good short-term 
solution and ensures that the Apache Pekko and Apache Flink Community can address critical bug fixes and security 
vulnerabilities throughout our software supply chain.

## Calcite Upgrade(s)

In Apache Flink 1.18, Apache Calcite was gradually upgraded from 1.29 to 1.32. The immediate benefit of these upgrades 
are bug fixes, a smarter optimizer and performance improvements. On a parser level, it now allows joins to be 
grouped into trees using parentheses (mentioned in SQL-92) e.g. `SELECT * FROM a JOIN (b JOIN c ON b.x = c.x) ON a.y = c.y` 
also see [CALCITE-35](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-35). In addition, the upgrade to Calcite 1.31+ has 
unblocked the support of Session Windows via Table-Valued Functions (see 
[CALCITE-4865](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4865), 
[FLINK-24024](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-24024)) and as a corollary the deprecation of the legacy 
group window aggregations. 
Due to [CALCITE-4861](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CALCITE-4861) Flink's casting behavior has slightly changed. 
Some corner cases might behave differently now: For example, casting from FLOAT/DOUBLE 9234567891.12 to INT/BIGINT has 
now Java behavior for overflows.

# Important Deprecations

In preparation for the release of Flink 2.0 next year, the community has decided to officially deprecate multiple APIs 
that were approaching end of life for a while.

* [``SourceFunction``](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-streaming-java/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/streaming/api/functions/source/SourceFunction.java) 
  is now officially deprecated and will be dropped in Flink 2.0. If you are still using a connector that is built on 
  top of ``SourceFunction`` please migrate it to 
  [``Source``](https://github.com/apache/flink/blob/master/flink-core/src/main/java/org/apache/flink/api/connector/source/Source.java).
  ``SinkFunction`` is not officially deprecated, but it is also approaching end-of-life and will be superseded by 
  ``SinkV2``.
* [Queryable State](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.17/docs/dev/datastream/fault-tolerance/queryable_state/) 
  is now officially deprecated and will be dropped in Flink 2.0. 
* [The DataSet API](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.17/docs/dev/dataset/overview/) is now 
  officially deprecated. Users are recommended to migrate to the DataStream API with 
  [execution mode](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/docs/dev/datastream/execution_mode/) ``BATCH``. 

# Upgrade Notes

The Flink community tries to ensure that upgrades are as seamless as possible.
However, certain changes may require users to make adjustments to certain parts
of the program when upgrading to version 1.18. Please refer to the 
[release notes](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-release-1.18/release-notes/flink-1.18/)
for a comprehensive list of adjustments to make and issues to check during the
upgrading process.
