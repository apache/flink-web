title: Flink Forward 2016 Call for Submissions Is Now Open
---

We are happy to announce that the call for submissions for Flink Forward 2016 is now open! The conference will take place September 12-14, 2016 in Berlin, Germany, bringing together the open source stream processing community. Most Apache Flink committers will attend the conference, making it the ideal venue to learn more about the project and its roadmap and connect with the community.

The conference welcomes submissions on everything Flink-related, including experiences with using Flink, products based on Flink, technical talks on extending Flink, as well as connecting Flink with other open source or proprietary software.
