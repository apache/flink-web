April was an packed month for Apache Flink. 

### Flink runner for Google Cloud Dataflow

A Flink runner for Google Cloud Dataflow was announced. See the blog
posts by [data Artisans](http://data-artisans.com/announcing-google-cloud-dataflow-on-flink-and-easy-flink-deployment-on-google-cloud/) and
the [Google Cloud Platform Blog](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.de/2015/03/announcing-Google-Cloud-Dataflow-runner-for-Apache-Flink.html).
Google Cloud Dataflow programs can be written using and open-source
SDK and run in multiple backends, either as a managed service inside
Google's infrastructure, or leveraging open source runners,
including Apache Flink.


## Flink 0.9.0-milestone1 release

The highlight of April was of course the availability of [Flink 0.9-milestone1]({{< siteurl >}}/news/2015/04/13/release-0.9.0-milestone1.html). This was a release packed with new features, including, a Python DataSet API, the new SQL-like Table API, FlinkML, a machine learning library on Flink, Gelly, FLink's Graph API, as well as a mode to run Flink on YARN leveraging Tez.
