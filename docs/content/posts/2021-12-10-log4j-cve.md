Yesterday, a new Zero Day for Apache Log4j was [reported](https://www.cyberkendra.com/2021/12/apache-log4j-vulnerability-details-and.html). 
It is by now tracked under [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). 

Apache Flink is bundling a version of Log4j that is affected by this vulnerability. 
We recommend users to follow the [advisory](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) of the Apache Log4j Community. 
For Apache Flink this currently translates to setting the following property in your flink-conf.yaml:

```yaml
env.java.opts: -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true
```

If you are already setting `env.java.opts.jobmanager`, `env.java.opts.taskmanager`, `env.java.opts.client`, or `env.java.opts.historyserver` you should instead add the system change to those existing parameter lists.

As soon as Log4j has been upgraded to 2.15.0 in Apache Flink, this is not necessary anymore. 
This effort is tracked in [FLINK-25240](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLINK-25240). 
It will be included in Flink 1.15.0, Flink 1.14.1 and Flink 1.13.3.
We expect Flink 1.14.1 to be released in the next 1-2 weeks.
The other releases will follow in their regular cadence.
