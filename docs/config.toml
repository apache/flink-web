  # Apache Flink uses a free plan for Slack, i.e. the number of users that can register via a
  # invite link is limited which makes it necessary to update this link every now and then.
  #
  # Any member of the Apache Flink Slack workspace can perform the following steps to generate the link:
  #  1. In the Apache Flink Slack workspace, click on "Apache Flink" in the top-left corner of your Slack app.
  #  2. In the dropdown menu, click on "Invite people to Apache Flink"
  #  3. Click "Edit link settings" and select "Never expires". Save the change.
  #  4. Copy the invitation link by clicking on "Copy invite link".
